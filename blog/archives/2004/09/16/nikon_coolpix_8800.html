<p>The new Coolpix 8800 is the 8700 replacement. For me it is a real surprise that the 8700 is already replaced by a camera with much better specs. This is the first Nikon digicam with VR (vibration reduction). I guess it gives you an extra 2 stops in low light conditions. Nikon promises 3 stops and photos should be sharp at 1/30s at 250mm. The second &#8216;major&#8217; improvement is the mode dial. The extra length on the tele side is a nice bonus. It reaches now from 35mm - 350mm (35mm equivalent). 
</p>
<blockquote>Nikon COOLPIX 8800 &#8212; The new flagship for the Nikon COOLPIX line comes equipped with 8-megapixel resolution, a high-powered 10x Zoom-Nikkor ED lens and Nikon’s extraordinary VR System.
</blockquote>
<p>The camera body is also designed by Giugiaro &#8212; like the 8400 and F6. However this one is just right! It is very similar to the 8700 but also different. The swivel display fits on the camera and doesn&#8217;t stick out. The camera is also bigger and heavier &#8212; because of swivel and lens. I&#8217;m happy that most buttons on the lens have gone. I sometimes accidently hit the wrong button. The lens now only has the AF/MF and VR buttons. Unfortunately no manual zoom and focussing.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice that we have an extra jpeg compression level called &#8220;Extra&#8221; although I&#8217;m completely happy with the &#8220;high&#8221; setting. I wonder if the same sensor is used as now the ISO goes from 50 to 400 instead of 800 with the 8700. The AF assist light is not integrated in the flash so it does not need to popup. Like the 8400 the USB is upgraded to 2.0.
</p>
<p>The lens is completely new. It is now a ten times zoom. It seems to be constructed in a single part unlike the coolpix 5700/8700. I hope that that also makes it mechanically stronger as a lot of people have had problems with it (LENS ERROR).</p>
<p>With the recently introduced coolpix 8700 I had no feeling that I wanted one. However with this digicam I already have the feeling that &#8220;I would not mind to have one&#8221;.</p>

 <p>I have found that with 'Lens Error' malfunctions with digital cameras, that a gentle bump on the side of the camera can sometimes reconnect the parts that are not recognizing each other.</p>

<p>I have experienced this encouragement technique to be successful with both Nikon and Canon digital cameras.</p>

 <p>I have owned the Coolpix 8800 for 9 months and it took fabulous photos until it stopped working and displayed a "lens error".  I have sent it back to Nikon for repair under the one year warranty, but now wish I'd gotten the extended warranty in case this turns out to be a chronic problem.</p>

 <p>I bought my Coolpix 2 months before my 2 month sojourne in India. One month into the journey it simply stopped in its tracks with the message "Lens Error". Even after I took the battery out for a week, re-inserted it, and even bumped it gently a few times, there was no recovery. I am seriously dissapointed, to say the least, as this was to be my "ultimate" camera!</p>

 <p>Bought the Coolpix 8800 in 2004 (DEC) XMAS gift, on Nov 16th 2005 the famous lens error occured, our first problem with the Camera. Today, Nov the 23rd I spent the better share of an hour on the phone with Nikon since they have had our Camera now for two + weeks. I talked with Service, then Digital Tech Support and no one knows or has "EVER" heard of the Problem???? HMMMM, kinda hard to swallow, However, I was told that they "COULD NOT" Duplicate the problem and it is on it's way back to us now. Suggestion was to write a letter to the "REPAIR MANAGER" concerning our delema. $1000.00+ and that was what was done for us and what we were told by "NIKON"!!! Ken.</p>

 <p>I've been using my Nikon Coolpix 3700 for a year plus when this supposedly famous lens error occurred. While i may not be much of a heavy user,still this has thus been the only problem i've encountered with the camera (*touch wood*). I was contemplating making use of my extended period warranty when a friend came across this blog and thought we'll try knocking the sides, never really though it'll work. It did. haha, i find that amazing. Save me some hassles. Thanks people.  </p>

 <p>Had my Coolpix 8800 for 1 year and 1 month, just had the first "Lens Error" problem myself, not very pleased at all!</p>

<p>Was on the brink of sending for repair when I decided to gogle the problem and found this site.</p>

<p>Thanks SO MUCH!, the little knock on the side of the sofa seems to have fixed the problem for now.</p>

<p>Back to happy shooting.</p>

<p>Cheers folks!</p>

 <p>I have a Coolpix 3700 and just got the dreaded "lens error" and was planning to send it back in.  Read this site and gave it a good bump on a paperback book (just as Tim described above) and it worked right away!  </p>

<p>Brilliant!</p>

 <p>No way!!  I was feeling persecuted as my "lens error" wasn't being solved by knocking it.  So in frustration gave it a really good tap while it was turned on and hey presto out popped the lens!!!  Miracle.  Thanks for the tip!</p>

 <p>On vacation in vienna I was really disappointed that I suddenly had a lens error with my Coolpix 8800. Even a call to my trusted supplier did not helped at all. After googling to this side and a firm kick to the lens part it did worked again. Thanks for this unconventional but working idea!!</p>

 <p>Someone posted the following advice for the lens error problem:</p>

<p>1. Turn camera off. Set it down so that the lens is sticking up.<br />
2. Push down on the middle of the lens until you hear a click.<br />
3. Cross your fingers and turn it on.</p>

<p>Anyway, that worked for me with my Coolpix 3200! Thanks to whoever figured it out.</p>

 <p>We have a Coolpix 3700 and already had to send it to Nikon to have a faulty lens replaced.  They fixed it fast with no issues.  Then we get this "Lens error" thing and guess what?  Our warranty period expired in March.</p>

<p>Then I came across this site.</p>

<p>I was encouraged by the high rate of success of others here knocking their camera on the side to fix the problem, but that wasn't working for me.  Then I tried knocking it on all sides until a knock on the front side (power off, lens retracted) worked.  I powered the camera up and the lens popped out!  Been working ever sense.</p>

<p>Thanks!!!</p>

 <p>My "Italian" Coolpix 8800 had the "errore obiettivo" i.e. "lens error" in the middle of a Dolomites week-end. I felt lost w/o internet support. Back home, the gentle knock solved the problem. Many thanks, but...<br />
now I have a kNnok-on camera ...</p>

 <p>Hi, I'm Tom and I'm a skeptic . . . . after my $1,000 Nikon 8800 froze up with what I learned is the infamous 'Lens Error,' I was searching the net to find a competent repair service.   Much to my good fortune I located this site and discovered the 'hard knock' repair.  Ya, right, smack my $1,000 investment around . . . well, let's give it a try.   One hard crack to the side of the camera and PRESTO . . . 'Lens Error' solved.  Now I think I'm even more upset that Nikon hasn't recalled these lemons to fix whatever bug it is that needs a beating. </p>

 <p>Just before my holiday to Iceland I managed to accidntly knock my Coolpix 8800 ever so slightly. I thought nothing of it until the dreaded lens error message appeared. After finding this site I applied the precision knock to the metal case of the retracted lens with the desired result. I do agree with Tom Nikon are not taking customer service seriously.   </p>

 <p>What a brillaint site this is! Having just encountered the (now infamous) "Lens Error" on my Coolpix L1 and reading the above comments, I decided to give the side of the camera body a gently whack on my desk. Bingo! No more "Lens Error" message, so I'm up and running again. Thanks for the info folks!</p>

 <p>We got his Nikon 'Lens Error' message this morning, very disppointing.<br />
I just applied the fix posted on this site & it worked. Te camera is a Nikon Coolpix L1, 10 months old.<br />
Turn the camera off, I gave the camera a sharp wack on the edge of a wood bookshelf. I wacked the side of the camera on the left (veiwfinder side) turned it on & to our surprise it worked.<br />
Thanks for Everyones Help<br />

 <p>Thank's everybody! You really saved my day! 8800, lens error, just like everybody here. Nothing worked, neither taking battery out, nore resetting the camera and reformatting the card (Nikon actually suggests that!), but hitting the camera gently with the palm of my hand in karate style fixed it. Took several attempts, though. How long will Nikon camera owners have be brutal to their cameras to get them working?!</p>

 <p>Nikon Coolpix 880 LENS ERROR</p>

<p>I've had my Coolpix 8800 for about a year. I turned it on today and got the message LENS ERROR. I quickly scanned the internet to find out what was up. I saw a posting about inserting the memory card whilt the camera was on then reformatting the card... and that didnlt work. I was resigned to having a dead camera when I read a posting sayig give it a thump on the side.</p>

<p>Having nothing to lose, I gave it a gentle but firm wack on the side and it now works again.</p>

<p>So, of anyone out there has a LENS ERROR problem, trying thumping it and see if you get lucky.</p>

 <p>We tried bashing the crap out of the nikon coolpix 3700 on a hard cover book, paper back book, bashed it on the side, bashed it front on...we almost broke the LCD screen. The LENS ERROR message just doesn't go away. This is so depressing. Please, please let me know what else I can do to make the LENS ERROR message on my camera go away and make the lens POP out.</p>

 <p>Yikes!  I was so nervous when I turned on my Nikon 8800 today to find "Lens Error"  I thought oh boy... an expensive visit to Nikon repair.  First I checked google and am sooooo glad I did.  First I was very upset to hear that this was such a common problem.  Then I read of many people fixing the problem with a smack on the side.  Hey hey hey... It worked.  :) Thanks so much for the info.</p>

I read these comments and it said gently hit it on the side.The first 12 times didnt work so i hit it a little harder and it surely worked again. Thanks u saved my butt!~!~! </p>

 <p>Just turned on the Coolpix 8800 and the lens did come out BUT the "Lens Error" message appeared.  I said, " Oy Veys Smear" Now what?<br />
Of course I googled and found this great site, one whack and it was gone..What the hecks making the camera do this?  perhaps something isn't touching internally or this is a cruel joke the Japanese are playing on us because of Clint Eastwoods film?  I dunno but I'm glad for this site it saved me a lot of grief.  The next time I'm in NYC by the United nations and see the Japanese ambassador I may hafta smak him in the head with the camera to see if it fixes the problem. :)</p>

 <p>My trusty old Coolpix 3200 gave me the dreaded lens error message today. After finding this site, I decided to give it a few whacks. I hit it on the lens side quite a few times with no success. But then I gave it one hit directly on the front, with the power off (as J Hodge describes above) and it worked like a charm! So if it doesn't work right away, be sure to try hitting it from every angle. Thanks to all who shared their advice here.</p>

 <p>I cannot beleive a little tap on the side of the lens barrel fixed the lens error that had me so stressed out all weekend.</p>

<p>By the way, I 1st got the error as turned on my camera yesterday morning. I had just arrived at the Grand Canyon and wanted to commence my photography.</p>

<p><br />
I just about threw that camera over the side I was soo angry and frustrated. Luckily I carry my S5 with me too!</p>

 <p>we bought a nikon coolpix L5 in vietnam and six weeks later lens error appeared.  the maual was in chinese so couldn't read it. I eventually fixed it  by turning on the camera and turning it off again before it said lens error and seems to be working fine now. previously i had turned it on and off lots of times with no luck.</p>

 <p>I had received the Lens Error message before and I noticed the lens was a little skewed. I messed around with it until it was straight, and the message went away.</p>

<p>However...today on the Staten Island ferry my Nikon Coolpix P4 (I also have a Nikon D70 but didn't venture to bring it with me to NYC) displayed the message again. I fiddled with the lens some more until it retracted. Now I was really confused. I tried hitting the camera like said on here, and nothing worked. I tried pressing on the lens, and that didn't work, either (perhaps because it was retracted).</p>

<p>After hitting it on the front several times, and harder than I ever thought I'd have to hit it, the error message went away. I would NOT recommend hitting your camera that hard unless gently knocking it doesn't work. I knew that replacing the lens would be as expensive as buying a new camera, so as a last resort I basically punched the front side with my palm. While my hand hurts now, it worked. The lens makes a different noise, but hopefully hitting this "wonderful" camera will continue to work.</p>

 <p>My Coolpix L1 had intermittent lens error messages nearly from new. I found it linked to battery type and freshness. It would go wrong running on recharchables but cure the error message with a nice new set of proper camera batteries.<br />
That no longer works so about to try bashing it.<br />
Does bashing cure for good and all or does lens error keep happening?<br />
Anyone been brave enough to dismantle, clean all visible contacts, smear with vaseline and put together again? (Always worked for me with car electrical faults).</p>

 <p>Does knocking the Nikon Coolpix 8800 camera work for "System Error 2" messages also?  My 2 year old camera started showing this message a week ago and lets me take one picture between boot-ups. Formatting old CF card and new CF card hasn't helped. </p>

 <p>I am not hard on my Coolpix 8800, but it hit a table as I was walking by and then the dreaded "Lens Error."  I tried taking the battery out over night, thumping the sides of the camera gently with a book, but when I tried the advice for Number 16 post, it worked like a charm.<br />
1. Turn camera off. Set it down so that the lens is sticking up.<br />
2. Push down on the middle of the lens until you hear a click.<br />
3. Cross your fingers and turn it on</p>
