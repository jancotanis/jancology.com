<p>Now the D2x is almost in the shops, we start to speculate about the D100 successor. <a href="http://www.bythom.com/">Thom</a> has of course updates his 2005 speculations and we&#8217;re expecting something like an D70 which is more durable that has about 8 mpix and an option for a vertical grip. To make it more professional looking &#8212; compared to the D70 &#8212; it has no scene modes. I&#8217;m not sure what the exact name will be of this camera. I think that D90 is nice as that compares to the excellent F90 or D200 as it gives you the feelings of a twice as good D100.
</p>
<p>We all wonder how it will look like so someone has photo-shopped something together using a D70 and a D2H. However I don&#8217;t think it will have an integrated vertical handgrip &#8212; more likely this will be sold as an addon.</p>
<img class="photo" src="../../../nikon/nikon-possible-d90.jpg" width="550" height="327" alt="Nikon D90 photoshopped (25kb)" />
<p>The next thing I want to know are the prices and specs of the D50 (7mpix auto-all camera of &euro; 699,-) and D3 (20mpix full frame).</p>

 <p>It's difficult to know how will be called the D100's succesor... Before digital cameras you could know wich camera was better: the F100 better than the F90, the F80 better than the F70 and so, but now I don't know how this will be... The D90 better than the D100? Of course it's just a matter of words and numbers, but it sounds strange, just as having a D50 better than the D70. So as you said, D200 would sound better.</p>

<p>A new D50? Well, what the D70 has is't all I think a camera has to have, so how will be this D50?</p>

<p>And about the D3, why a full frame sensor? If Nikon is going to release one of this, it has to be just for marketting strategies because we don't need full frame sensors anymore. DX sensor (APS like) is OK: it has the same proportions as a 35mm slide or negative (3:2, that's 1.5 ratio), in fact, it's simillar to the original 35mm format (18x24mm, wich is still used on movie films). Being smaller, the DX sensor can be faster and cheaper so the only reason to have a full frame sensor it's to keep on using old 35mm wide lenses. Nikon have three DX wide zoom lenses (12-24, 17-35 and 18-70mm) and even an ultra wide lense (10.5mm). Canon have a full frame sensor but most of their cameras have APS like sensors (just like the new 20D) and they are releasing wide lenses for this size (the new 10-22mm is an example). So, in my opinion, the old 35mm size is part of the past and all we need is more DX lenses. If the new Nikon D3 will have a full frame sensor it has to be just for competing with Canon's one, but right now Nikon's DX sensor is all we need. Of course, IMHO.  :) </p>

 <p>Hi sir, <br />
Would you know the specs of the D90 and when would they release it? Since im buying a digital camera im considering the Fuji S3 but a friend of mine here in the philippines told me to wait for D90.  He told me that it would be out in the market this month of January 2005.  Im just wondering if you can give me some things that could help me decide which one to buy.  thanks and hoping for your immediate response. regards. <br />

 <p>It certainly won't come out this month. It migh be anounced at the <a href="http://pma2005.pmai.org/">PMA 2005</a>. Untill that we don't know for sure what the specs are. Guess that it will be a 8-12 mpix camera.</p>

 <p>I want to purchage nikon d70, one of my friend sugested that I should wait for the Nikon d90. what should I do?</p>

<p>Don't wait.</p>

<p>what will be the price of nikon d90?</p>

<p>Well, first of all it depends where. USA? Japan? Somewhere in Europe? One thing is right: it will replace the D100 so it's price will be more or less the same or a bit higher, allways thinking it has to compete with the new Canon 20D. You can be sure it will cost at least $400/500 more than the D70. If the D90 is a 8MP, I prefer the D70. Even if it is a 10MP, I still prefer the D70 since you need 24MP to have twice the resolution of a 6MP camera, so 10 it's not a really big difference.</p>

<p>If you don't need a metal body (only needed for a pro) and a vertical grip/battery pack, the D70 is all you need.</p>

<p>The D70 is one of the best DSLR you can buy today, even better, in many aspects, than very expensive pro cameras from Canon or Nikon. It's far superior than it's direct competitor, the Rebel/300D, and in most aspects, those really importants for amateurs like me, it can compete with more expensive cameras like the Nikon D100 or the new Canon 20D.</p>

<p>So, if you can buy it today, buy it. When the D90 will come (it is still vaporware) you will have thounsands of beautiful photos taken with your D70. And you will be able to keep on taken photos after that.</p>

 <p>It will be good if Nikon come up with a D200 and a D3 full frame, D200 with DX sensor with 8 to 10 million will be an answer toCano but also an serious alternative for analog DSLR users.<br />
A D3 full frame with 20 MP is necesary for the proffesional market, why size matters , maybe more then the number of pixels. Bigger size of the sensor result in better performance (color, lightsensitivity, etc etc) it has nothing to do with the old 35mm frame but with quality, Mamiya shows a DSLR with a 38x52mm sensor for these reason<br />
So make a long story short: bigger sensors is higher quality</p>

 <p>D70 is not that great. Simply a entry level cheap plastic bodied model, good flash but no MLU, poor noise with a very mediocre 200iso. It was made cheap to compete with the Canon 300d and it did a better job but these people who think the D70 is the equal of a Pro camera like a D2X are just embarrasing themselves by making them look like they know nothing. These D70 people always justify the lack of the features on the D70 by knocking better models from Nikon and Canon. LOL !</p>

 <p>speculation around the d70. d100 replacement has seen interesting comments coming from many replacements, nikon themselves have not yet confirmed that the d70 will be replaced at the conference in a weeks time nor have they stated that a competitor for the canon d20 has been developed, I think peoples imaginations are starting to get the better of them as the nikonians of the world look for the next best thing.</p>

 <p>Poeple,</p>

<p>The purpose of a full frame sensor (or larger) is not to accommodate the traditional 35mm lens focal lenghts (like many claim).  The purpose of a full frame sensor (or larger) is to gain higher image quality and reduce NOISE. The more pixels crammed onto a tiny APS sized sensor, the higher the noise level.  Canon really beat Nikon on this one.  Nikon will have to come out with a full frame sensor or lose out to Canon.  </p>

 <p>There is only one reason for a full frame Nikon: Canon. Did you know that probably Nikon needs a new lens mount or a new range of lenses to work with a full frame sensor? Even Canon with a larger lens mount can have problems with full frame cameras (vigneting, light falloff and so on), so shooting a wide angle lens on a full frame Nikon can be very dissapointed...</p>

<p>IMHO, there is nothing wrong in APS sensors (DX from Nikon and even that from the 4/3 system), just think of this:</p>

<blockquote>The more pixels crammed onto a tiny APS sized sensor, the higher the noise level.</blockquote>
Well, with the D2X we have now in the same DX sensor more than twice the number of pixels than in a D70... Do you find the noise levels twice worse?

     This was shot at f2, with flash bounced directly behind me into the open room to just help lift the shadows.

 there is NO flash shadow.I purposely didn‚Äôt use a diffuser dome / Stofen omnibounce here,<br />
 since it would‚Äôve thrown too much flash directly forward. I needed all the flash to be indirect</p>
