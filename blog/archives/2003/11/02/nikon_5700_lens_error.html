     <h2>Nikon 5700 Lens Error</h2>

     <div class="log-content">

<p>Today my Nikon Coolpix 5700 died with a lens error. This problems seems to be one of the biggest issues with this camera.</p>
<p>I first tried to fix the issue myselves. When turning off the camera, the lens also goes back inside the camera. I tried to push a bit and hope that the gears would pick up again. Unfortunately not and the system still made the same rattling sounds.</p>
<div class="sidepanel-right"><img src="../../../nikon/nikon-5700-ur-e8-72mm.jpg" class="photo" alt="Nikon Coolpix 5700 with UR-E8 and 72mm thread (18kb)" width="377" height="309" /></div>
<p>Because I knew about the problem, I actually searched the internet last week for the prices of the ur-e8 adapter. This adapter, which is primarely used to attach the various tele and wide angle convertors, can also be used to protect the lens when it is out of the camera. Together with <a href="http://members.rogers.com/nextphoto/order5700.htm">Bernie&#8217;s 72mm Thread Adaptor (Part # NP0030)</a> it will also protect the lens. Unfortunately I&#8217;m too late now. I hope it will be fixed soon. I send if of to the supplier which will send it to Nikon repair. They think it will at least take up to 15 working days before its repaired. I should be under guarantuee (till 22 november actually!)

 <p>I had a lens error also.  Then lens would not move.  I removed the battery for about 5 min and turned the camera back on and it started working again.  I have an adapter.. I do not use it every time.  What is the root cause of the problem?  Does anybody know?</p>

 <p>Also, got a lens error today on this 60-day old camera. From what I've seen on web searches, this is a design problem (among others) with this camera. These vaunted Nikon optics are only great if you can use the camera!</p>

 <p>the problem is that the design of the gears is not strong enough, or maybe a kind of lens-lock is missing to protect the gear box</p>

 <p>Found your site after doing a Google search for "Lens Error".</p>

<p>Problem happened just within the warranty period for my 5700. I talked to a person named Murray at Nikon Tech. Of course, he had not heard of this problem before so Nikon is not admitting that the gear set is weak.</p>

<p>Interestingly, he was not interested in either performing a search for lens error on Google or having me send him a list of URL's. Instead, he simply dismissed me by saying "I don't know what you have heard on the internet, but this is an isolated problem". </p>

<p>We are on our own when it happens out of warranty.</p>

 <p>Look's like I've just found the information I needed. Unfortunately. Yesterday when taking my 5700 out of it's case I was too hasty switching it on and the case fouled the lens causing a nasty rattling noise. Now the lens won't extend. I am very disappointed. I bought the camera based on Nikon's reputation and I thought I was getting a well built camera.</p>

 <p>Day before Fathers Day and bingo.  Lens error and grinding.  I use the UR8 and Nikon filter adapter.  Didnt seem to help my problem from occurring.  4 months out of waranty, I have to sent it on to Nikon service now.  If enough complaints get posted, I can give them to Nikon and ask them to reimburse the expenses for fixing this cheap part which should be recalled.</p>

 <p>My Coolpix 3100 is about 6 months past warranty and just went into a "Lens Error". My brother also has an older model Coolpix than mine and also has experienced the same problem. I'm sure Nikon has heard of this by now and has probably chosen not to fix it since it seems to be occurring in even more expensive models than mine. I agree, there should be a recall. If I am forced to buy another, it will surely not be a Nikon.</p>

<p>Missing my old SLR...</p>

 <p>Got back my Coolpix 5700 from Nikon today.  Cost:  $225.18!   Stupid thing accidentally turned on when putting it in the NIKON approved case.  No where for the lens to go so it jammed.  Gears were replaced.  Plastic junk inside.  </p>

<p>Always had a Nikon and never trouble like this.  Nikon should not sink to new lows to try to stay competitive with junk quality.</p>

 <p>My Nikon 5700 camera is 2 months beyond my year's warranty. Within the warranty period, my flash stopped popping up - had to return it to Nikon to fix it. Now I've just gotten an Lens Error message. The lens retracted almost all the way, but not quite. Not happy about this.</p>

 <p>Our Coolpix 5700 had the lens gears replaced twice under warranty, and now the thing has broken again just two months past warranty expiration.  This is ridiculous.  Nikon is supposed to be the best, so why don't they recall this obviously flawed lens system???</p>

 <p>Today I turned on my Nikon 5700 Cool Pix Camera and heard a gritty sound before realizing that the lens were stuck. I turned off the camera but the lens remained partially extended and would not retract. When I tried to  turn it on again A MESSAGE APPEARED IN RED "LENS ERROR". I have had the camera for 18 months.</p>

<p>Any recommendations?</p>

 <p>Hi!!<br />
After dropping my husband's camera I got the lens error message.<br />
!!! I don't know anything about cameras. So I searched on the net and found you guys.<br />
More I read more scared I got. Problem with no solution!!!!!<br />
Well I tried charging the battery but nothing changed. <br />
After a couple of prays I started fooling around with the lens. A sound like a pop happened and then the camera started working again.<br />
Looks like the fall made the lens go to the side of the camera and it got stuck there.<br />
When I moved it the lens whet back to the center position.<br />
I'm so happy now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

 <p>Me too me too! Yeah yeah, same story, different sucker. I accidentally turned my 5700 on while it was in the case. I had reached inside to search for my spare compact flash card. You already know the outcome (Lens Error – Surprise!). Looks like we're all in the same boat.  There is definitely one option for those of us who have been screwed out of our money; it’s called “Class Action”.  I am sure there will be (or has been) some attorney on this site with the same issue that would love to get paid with such an open and shut case. Don’t get me wrong, I do love the Nikon optics but come on, them not owning up to this obvious flaw is lame.  So, in conclusion, if there’s a lawyer out there interested in taking this case (which I am sure affects thousands @ $200-$300 each, in just repair cost alone) please feel free to add me (Judah Stroud - $285.00) to your C.A. lawsuit. For the rest of y’all, I’m sorry you too have reached this page in anticipation of some simple resolution and found that all you’ll receive is a little solace knowing you’re not alone.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />
Judah Stroud<br />

 <p>Add me to the list of owners of the 5700 with the "Lens Error". Happened to me last night.<br />
 $300 for a repair? Not Happy.<br />
Was thinking about a new camera in about 18 months, but with this problem I guess it will be advanced a little sooner. The 5700 lasted for a few weeks past 2 years. The only complaint I had was the low light performance of the camera. Was looking at a true digital SLR as the replacement to the 5700. Wonder if they have upgraded the lens gears in the 8800 model?</p>

 <p>I've had my 5700 about 22 months. I just came back from a 2 week trip to Inida. Sunday I went to a 1/4 scale train meet with just unbeleiviable shots and I get my camera out and "LENS ERROR". I too have gotten a price of 300.00, I'm very disappointed in Nikon. <br />
I guess at this point I have to move on and realize I got a lemon. I'm thinking of the D70 so I can use my lens off my Nikon 35mm, any comments...?</p>

 <p>Hi!!!</p>

<p>So YAY. You know why I am here, camera somehow turned on in my bag.</p>

<p>Look ppl, I work for a duty free store and now I have had enough with Nikon, the colours aren't as good as other cameras and their service is awful. I bought my camera in Copenhagen a while back and soon after I got a "Hot Pixel" in the middle of the picture. Under warranty? sure was, had it about a month, would they fix it in Australia? No way.</p>

<p>So now I have this problem and finally have cracked the shits. Don't look for another model. Look for another brand. I have tried many canon cameras and they are much, much better in every way (including price)</p>

<p>PS.. Nikon just slashed their prices again to stay competetive. Does that mean cheaper parts and crappier service. I would bet.</p>

 <p>wow... this is sad.. and I'm stung HARD.. I have the BRAND NEW Nikon CoolPix 8800... Less than 3 days old "LENS ERROR" right before the Thanksgiving Holiday. And I didn't do anything to the camera. I took a few shots.. powered it back on later to take a few more and.. it was over. The thing was hanging around my neck the whole time. <br />

 <p>5700. Lens Error after about 6 months. Same again a month later.</p>

<p>In both cases nothing stressfull done to th camera. In both cases taking out the battery for a few hours and then replacing it followed by ejecting and replacing the CF card (with camera powered up) fixed the problem.</p>

<p>Still very unhappy though, so shipped it back to Nikon (under warranty). Who knows what (if anything) they did to it as it was working when I shiped it out. Got it back yesterday with a cryptic invoice from Svc people. Cost $181 - reduced to zero as warrany still in force.</p>

<p>I expect this will happen again! ;-(</p>

Yesterday I got the red message "Lens Error" in my 2 months old Coolpix 2200.<br />
As I can see it means: "BAD NEWS"</p>

<p>Let's try to get the Brazilian Nikon dealer (there is only one here) to "start the figth"</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />

 <p>Cannot believe so many people have the same "Lens Error" problem. I got my Nixon 3700 7 weeks ago and battery needed to be recharged although i didnt recharge it fully lens error popped up as soon as i turned it on. Im over careful with my gadgets and i know i did not drop it. Guess im joing a long queue of pissed off people. Thing is mine was a gift from Ireland and i have now moved to Japan. Bummer</p>

 <p>I'm Mark that posted November 19, 2004 03:32 PM... just as a recap I had a Nikon CoolPix 8800 that failed with "lens Error" (just like Robin's of Dec 21st)... being close to Thanksgiving, to be frank I got really pissed and thought if it's going back I'll make sure it's "malfunctioning".. gave it a !whack! (nothing crazy... think of a microwave door closing)on the lens with the cap on (cam powered on so lens would extend)... it's been working ever since.</p>

<p>PS; took some great Thanksgiving day pics anyway.</p>

<p>PPS: above discribed method was performed by a professional angry person... please don't try this at home.</p>

 <p>Nikon is gone! Mitsubishi is broke.</p>

<p>It took over 8 months to repair my 5700, guess what? It still doesn’t work, this is my second one, the first one failed after 2 weeks. The worst part is they damaged it during the repairs, bunch of f@#k heads!</p>

<p>A Sony would have been better!</p>

 <p>I am getting very worried now folks. I have had my 5700 for four months now and have had the lens error fault three times. Guess compaired to some I'm lucky as turning off and back on again fixed it. Having said that there was no reason for the error as I am very careful with my camera.<br />
I also hate the way this camera performs in low light conditions....it simply doesn't, I have to use another camera.  The Nikon is rubbish.<br />
  Reading this forum it's looking more likely that I will buy myself the Canon digital Rebel....unless someone knows better.<br />

 <p>Recently bought the Coolpix 8800 and had it abroad on holoiday with me over Christmas. One monring I switched on and the LCD display said "lens error". The camera had worked fine 60 minutes before and nothing had been done to it. Tried the usual route of taking battery out, setting defaults, removing CF card etc. No good. The camera was dead for some 4 days each day showing the same error. Then after about 4 days I switched it on and no problem.</p>

<p>Anyone know what the cause of this is?</p>

 <p>Hi people,</p>

<p>Same fucking story here. Had my 3700 for 6 weeks. Camera was bought in Turkey But I live in Australia (looks like I'm the turkey). The biggest turkey of course is NIKON. Yes they've ripped everyone off with their cheap parts. WILL WE STAND FOR IT? NO FUCKING WAY! How do we get in touch with the people in charge? Because I know they wouldn't be happy about the amount of customers that they will lose if they don't do something Quick!..Recall? I think this is their only choice if they dont want to lose their Increasingly shaky reputation. I just hope nikon has read this post. ADD ME TO THE LAWSUIT!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>My 3100 indicated "lens error" information yesterday and stop working. And then I'm here. So it seems the cheapest way for me it to dump this Nikon, right? Oh my....I know at least another friend had the same problem with his 5700. Nikon really sucks.</p>

 <p>Well... guess what.  I took three pictures of my kids playing, turned the camera off and then back on again to show my husband the shots... and LENS ERROR.  What a piece of crap.  Three pictures?  Thats like $150 per photo.  Not worth it.  I bought Nikon because I THOUGHT it was a quality brand, but I will not make that mistake again.  I think I am going to try throwing it down the stairs to fix it.  Unfortunately it is not under warranty any longer. :(</p>

 <p>Here is my 2 cents... I bought a coolpix 3100 on 12/28/03 from best buy at Waterford Lakes in Orlando Florida.. Just about two weeks after the 1 year warranty expired, 1/14/05, the camera went haywire... Everything works except when put into Camera Mode.. The Lens extends, then immediately retracts and the Camera shuts off.. During the time The camera turns on and then off, the LCD displays a blank screen, and then a ~100ms flash of a square image that is about a quarter the size of the lcd and the image is rotated about 30 degrees, and is in the top right of the lcd. After it flashes on and off, the camera shuts off..<br /><br /> I took it to best buy and was forced to pay a small fee for them to send it away and waited a couple weeks to hear how much it will be to fix it. I am told it will be $172 to fix... SO, tonight I became a bit suspicious and decided to see if this is a common problem with their camera and perhaps to check if there is a scam going on with Nikon. If I refuse to pay for them to fix the camera and decide to buy a new one, then they keep the camera, do a simple fix, and resell it. I will not let that happen, and will instead tell them to send me back the camera and then buy a new one. <br />
<br /> <br />I believe there is something going on with the cameras. I beleive the problem is known internally throughout Nikon, however, since it is a Japanese company, there is little that can be done. <br /><br />These cameras are probably assembled in China by the lowest bidder, and the bidder decided to use a different part than what was required so they can make more money assembling the camera. Now that the cameras are breaking, Nikon probably cut any more deals from the bidder, however, Nikon will not admit this because they do not want to be known for rubberstamping their cameras from a Chinese assembler, so they are sweeping the dirt under the rug... <br /><br />I'm quite interested to see and read what else goes on with Nikon Cameras.. Hope this bit of Info is useful, and if there is any case, email me and let me know, I want in...<br /><br />Steve R</p>

 <p>I used to be a NIKON fan for awhile. Had a CP 950 for years and was happy with it. Then "upgraded" to the 5700 and in less than a year the problem started: Lens would not extend all the way, zoom no longer worked and made a grinding noise and, eventually, the dreaded "Lens Error" message. I had never dropped the camera or otherwise mishandled it. I was frustrated and bought the Canon Powershot Pro1. What a difference! Well, I guess I can still use the 5700 as a nice looking paper weight.</p>

 <p>I brought my camera two years paid $1400.00 for it. Brought 300.00 SB Flash, 170.00 telephoto len and just spent 300.00 to fix lens error and its been 1 month and now I camera does nto turn on. Oh forgot to mention the 90.00 backpack to protect the camera so I don't have problems with it. I think for over the $2000.00 I spend that I would have a camera that works. I have owned Minlota's, Pentex, Sony, and Canon camera's and not one time did I ever had to repair them and I only paid $500.00 for the Camera. I waited a long time to own a Nikon Digtial to only be very disappointed with it.  I will never buy Nikon brand again because thier service stinks and thier cameras are junk. I am going back to Canon Brand. Just had lens error fixed paid 300.00 and its only been 30 days and 50 pictures later and they want another $300.00 to fix it again.I will be damn if I give them another penny. Please anyone have any Idea's who I can contact to fix my camera. I don't want to put any more money into this peice of junk I will take a hammer to it before I put 1 more penny to make it work. Canon I am coming back.  </p>

 <p>My zoom unit was protected by a Nikon filter adapter ring and a Nikon UV filter, but I got the lens error.<br />
I have paid 312EUR (400$) to the Nikon Repair Centre in Spain (Finicon) in order to fix the Coolpix 5700 lens error. They have replaced all the zoom unit.<br />
It was a mistake to buy Nikon. It was a mistake to repair the camera.</p>

 <p>I bought a 5700 in Spain, where I am from, and got the damned lens problem too. I paid 1200 euros for it, but I am not taking it to be fixed since this is what Nikon wants, I will do what they don't want: buy a CANON.</p>

 <p>Well, after being lifetime customer of Nikon from back in the Nikon FE manual camera days to the newer 8008s slr I moved to digital Nikon 5700. It's been a good camera for over a year but a while ago the lens started acting strange, extending with a bump when I used telephoto. Now it just comes up with lens error. I'm not going to spend $300 dollars to fix this thing.  Their tech support has always sucked. And after reading all these entries I'm unlikely to stick with Nikon gear. This is going to be a pr nightmare for them.</p>

 <p>I received the 3100 as a christmas gift in Dec '03.  The first time I had to deal with Nikon, they had my camera for about 3-4 months before the vendor replaced it free of charge because I was still WAITING FOR A QUOTE.  Two months later, when they sent me a quote, I refused.</p>

<p>After about a year with the new camera, I now have the infamous lens error.  I've searched the web, and I see it's pretty much hit or miss if you're able to fix it on your own.  My poor lens extends about 1 millimeter before retracting, repeating a couple of times, then calling it quits.  I might have to get erectile dysfunction medicine for the poor camera and call it a night...</p>

 <p>Add one more to the list. I've had my 5700 long enough to be out of warranty and I have had the lens error several times as a result of the lens cap cord getting pinched because I put the lens cap on before I shut it off. But the last time that it happened it cost me $225 (American).<br />
Funny thing is I have a friend who is looking for a digital camera. I was recommending the 5700 but now I will just send him a link to this site! Suck on that Nikon!!!<br />
Oh, and I have a few more friends and I belong to a group that has a group email address, I get get this link to 100 email associates in one fell swoop. Maybe Nikon monitors this site (one would hope?). Maybe the rest of you should do what you can to put the word out there. Maybe Nikon won't make it right for us, but we can make it right for them.</p>

 <p>Does this sound familiar:</p>

<p>Nikon Coolpix 3100<br />
13 months old<br />
lens error</p>

<p>My previous Coolpix 2500 did the same thing and I was silly enough to buy another!<br />
What a sorry state of affairs that a company should prosper whilst having so many disappointed customers!</p>

 <p>My Coolpix 3100 stopped working (lens error) at my neice's wedding.  Later I fiddled with the lens and got it to work for a week.  NOw it has failed and doesn't seem to want to revive.  Mine, too is only about 16 months old.  Glad I wasn't on vacation when it went.  So, what camrea does anyone recommend?   </p>

 <p>Must be a 3100 problem, mine had always made crunchy noises beforehand when in macro mode.I dropped it whilst the lens was extended last night and it got stuck and i got the lens error msge.I did what the other person who dropped<br />
the camera did and fiddled with lens and hit it into place and it went back and the lens error message went away.Now it turns on normally i can take photos all great and normal.But when I turn it off it makes some really crunchy noises and doesnt turn off straight away and i get the "lens error" again.</p>

<p>Its a shame because the camera itself is great,Ive had a canon and a nikon,both have had many problems,I just had the canon repaired.The only camera ive never had any problems with is my first digiam an olympus.</p>

 <p>Hi folks, I'm the same Mark that posted Nov19th and Dec22nd... the guy that got so angry with "lens error" I gave my (just released) $900+ Nikon Coolpix 8800, a firm whack of about five pounds falling about 8inches from the ground. I thought I would come back and say if that camera wasn't under warantee I would NEVER have tried that. I've gotten emails from people that read my post tried it and it seems to work for everyone bold enough to risk it. But I don't advise it.</p>

<p>That said I also thought I'd let all of you know in April.. six months and over 2000 pictures later, the Nikon Coolpix 8800 is still going strong without a problem since. </p>

<p>.... and that I look forward to my next CANON digital camera :-)</p>

<p>PS. I'm sad to hear that this is still happening to so many people because I know how bad I felt.</p>

 <p>Same problem here,<br />
We've had a 5700 here at work for over a year, and all of a sudden it's getting the Lens Error.  I didn't reccomend it before this happened because of very poor low light quality and lack of decent focus, but I'll steer people far away from now on.  I think Nikon's trying to boost their profits with service payments.  The parts at the website mentioned earlier seem to amount to about $12.  I'll probably try to fix it myself to save the headache of sending it away.<br />
Thanks for the resource!</p>

 <p>Up until today I turned my Nikon on a said "I love my Nikon" but Just as I was checking for new gadgets to buy for my 5700, I turned it on and bang - click click click - lens error. Reading the above doesn't fill me with glee and although my post is perhaps of no help to anyone I thought I should add one to help boost the numbers of this seemingly very common fault. Thank you Janco for making this site available. Now Im off to see if my Mack warrenty is worth the paper its written on... </p>

 <p>Hi, <br />
  I got my second hand coolpix 5400 couple of days ago and I was kindly surprised by the quality of the pictures that I've taken until today when I realised that I've joined the bloody "lens error" club. It makes me just hate Nikon and their ignorance by not doing anything about it. However, it seems to me that there dozens of cameras with a lense error problem. That the camera is out of warranty doesn't make me feel any f**** better. I am so frustrated and pissed off. Any practical tricks or suggestions will be very appreciated.<br />

 <p>And another one, it's my nikon 5700. All of a sudden, the lens did not want to move after it worked fine a few minutes ago. What happened Nikon??? I read through this read and found that people can only use nikon 5700 for around +- 2yrs until the "lens error" occurs. I don't know whether others used the camera often or not but I only used it sometimes. </p>

<p>The repair service is too expensive. I don't know it's worth to send it to be repaired or to add a couple hundred dollars on top of the repair cost to buy a better version.</p>

<p>The "Lens Error" problem happened on many Nikon 5700 cameras and counting. This is definitely a flaw and I want to protest for a "Free Repair Service for Lens Error" slogan.</p>

 <p>A few months ago, my 3700 (within warranty) developed the "lens error" problem after the lens retracted accidentally while something was brushing against it. From reading the comments on this web site, I knew exactly how to report my problem to Nikon service, and they fixed the problem for free within a week of receiving it. Thanks for the valuable information.</p>

 <p>I get the same problem with my Nikon "Foolpix" 5700. Great photos and then the lens error message. I originally thought it was due to harsh treatment during fieldwork, now I see it is a generic problem that Nikon should have the sense to fix for free. If it was a car it would have been recalled. I get the lens error message regularly, usually apparently fixed by turniung the camera off and on agian, but occasionally I need to take the battery out and re-insert it. I don't think the pics I am taking are as good as they were originally, and focussing on close-up things is more tricky.</p>

<p>I am in favour of a class action, or at the very least a letter signed by dozens of people that should be sent to Nikon and give them 28 days to rectify the mistakes at their expense (including those now out of warranty). f they don't agree we should jointly write to camera mags - I doubt if they receive many letters on such a high profile camera company that are signed by say 100 people.</p>

<p>Good luck to you all</p>

 <p>My daughter came home from college with the 6 month old Coolpix 2200 she got for Christmas.  As soon as I turned it on I saw the "Lens Error" flash on the LCD and knew I was in trouble.  She's been very careful with this camera, and I think it's a shame that they made them so cheap.  I paid extra for the Nikon lens and reputation for quality.  They're still rated at the top by Consumer Reports, but they don't evaluate reliability, like they do for so many other items.  I suspect, as others have similar problems, this will change, and Nikon will suffer sales losses.</p>

 <p>I just had 2 8700's go down w/ "Lens Error" a few weeks ago... one was about a year old, the other fresh out of the box - might even have been the first picture ever taken with the camera. These were part of a month-long time lapse experiment at Columbia Glacier in Alaska. Compared to the expense of setting up the experiment and the lost data, the cost of the 2 cameras is trivial. Not happy at this point.</p>

 <p>Just a follow up, my 5700 did the lens error thing back in March. After taking out the battery for a while, then rocking the lens back and forth a bit with a screwdriver and inserting the batter back in the lens started working again. It would grind at a certain telescopic extension but if I kept pushing the button it would work its way past that point. Then it got to the point where it would jam at that extension point and wouldn't retract when powering off. I found that by using power assist (my other hand ;) I could pull and push the lens past the jammed points. It does wear the batter down faster and at some point I'm sure even this workaround will fail as the internals get all chewed up. But it's given me 3 more months of use out of a camera I would otherwise throw in the trash.</p>

<p>Don't do any of this if you plan to have your camera repaired!!</p>

 <p>UK user. Purchased my 5700 december 2002, sent it off yesterday 18 July 2005, but only 2668 pictures, lens error!. Now I find this site, oh how depressing all those years with Canon and not a single fault, even wore out an SLR. EOS 5 15 yrs old and still going. My Pro brother and Nikon enthusiast father persuaded me. I knew I was right your just buying the Nikon badge. 5700 great idea, bad design and implementation. <br />
Have Nikon admited the problem yet?</p>

<p>And now my last post. July 20th 2005... Seven months, And many thousands of wonderful pictures (I think my counter was up in the 5 thousands)...</p>

<p>a few weeks ago my SUV was towed and while thankfully my two notebooks where still there, My nikon coolpix 8800 was no where to be found. <br />
You know the story, The towing company claimed it was never in the vehicle.</p>

<p>I had just gotten really comfy with the camera and it's functions (or the lack thereof in low light)... I overcame the dreaded "LENS ERROR" (see Dec 28th post)... But one trip to Niagara, New York and an unfortunate tow and it's all over.</p>

<p>I'm saving up to get a Canon Rebel XT (8MP dSLR) if any of you have it email me and tell me what you think about it.<br />
Bottom line on the Nikon 8800: I thought it was a wonderful camera 4 of 5 stars (The lens error flaw is a pity)<br />

 <p>bought my 3700 after holidaying with a friend who owns the same model - he had a lens error which rectified itself and i didnt even remember there was a problem til it happened to me!! i was getting the horrors about halfway down this long list of complaints and would you believe dropped the camera from my lap whilst reading. turned itself on and the lens was working as normal. </p>

<p>so if you're out of warranty and nikon are in denial, drop it :D worked for me!!</p>

 <p>Unbelievable.</p>

<p>My three (3 !!) days old 3700 already got its lens error 30 minutes ago.  Grrrr! </p>

<p>I owned CP2000 for over 3 years with no problem (fed it enough daily diet of AA batteries and it's happy).  Also an FA with mirror lock up problem only after oh some 20 yrs of ownership.  </p>

<p>Interestingly I was warned by salesperson about potential lens error when I bought Canon G3.  Of course it never caught any lens virus - despite bumping lens cap every now and then.</p>

<p>Too bad.  Beautiful colors and sharp pics destroyed by this ridiculous cost cutting parts.  <br />

 <p>Nikon "lens error" on Coolpix 7900. </p>

<p>I own a Nikon coolpix 7900 for little less then 2 months and then I got this "lens error" problem already.  I used to own 3 Canon digital cameras and I have never encountered any problem with them before. Because of Nikon's good reputation I decided to buy my first Nikon camera.  Big mistake! Nikon just ruined my day!</p>

<p>I hope this is just an bad apple but it looks like it is more than that from the comments above.  I just sent my camera to the Nikon service center today and hope I get it back fixed.</p>

<p>So far after reading this site, these are the problem cameras.  Add to the list if you know other models that have this problem.</p>

 <p>Just purchased a Nikon CP 7900. Out of the box for about ten minutes and the lens freezes in the out position. What a bummer. It's troubling to see all of these comments. I wonder if I should go with the Canon SD500. </p>

<p>Thanks for all the info at this site.</p>

 <p>Darn it!  Like most of you, I expected a simple fix for my 5400 Lens Error. Well out of warranty, I am left with the difficult choice of risking the repair money or jumping ship.  It's too bad because the 5400 has been a good little machine for my business pictures.</p>

 <p>I don't think I am adding a great deal to the sum of human knowledge, but I too have a Coolpix 2200 with "lens error".  Strictly speaking it is intermittent in that it has managed to start up a couple of times - but immediately falls over if I try to zoom.  It is less than 1 month old and only started this weekend so I haven't had a chance to get back to the vendor yet and haven't anything to report on the service side - but I did take it in to a dealer in a major UK photo retail chain who was - shall we say - "familiar" with the "issue".</p>

 <p>Update on repair of my 5700. Sent to Nikon UK for repair. Got estimate fo £140+vat. Phoned around authorised repairers got est of £80. Phoned Nikon asked them to return camera unfixed. Nikon have choosen to repair the camera FREE of CHARGE. However, before asking for return, I did ask them to accept that the camera has a design fault and they should fix this issue for free. I also included a strongly worded letter stating my views about the design and reliability of Nikon products. <br />
I suggest that you all start using the same tactics, let them have the camera for estimate and then moan a lot (mention this site) and then ask for a no fix return. Maybe they'll get the message. <br />
PS repair was replace one gear wheel.</p>

 <p>I'm unfortunately joining this growing Nikon "Lens Error" group. My Coolpix 8800 was a refurbished camera from NikonMall and was supposedly brought up to specs by Nikon prior to sale. But within a couple dozen shots, it came up with the dreaded "Lens Error" message. It is doubley troublesome since it was purchased from the US and I'm in Canada and Nikon Canada won't honour purchases beyond their border.</p>

 <p>Bernard, I too have the same problem with the blank screen/viewfinder.  Used it, left it on my table for a week and then tried to use it.  Wasn't dropped or anything.  I've search the net extensively and haven't found any remedies. This problem isn't as common as the "Lens Error" problems but I have seen it on a few post.  No answers so far.  I'll check back here and hope for the best.  This is my 1st and last Nikon product!!! So frustrating!!!</p>

Please post what happens.  I'd like to know what I'm in for.  If cost is too high, I'll probably buy something else.  I'm not pro but not a beginner either.  Probably go with the Cannon Digital Rebel with interchangeable lenses.  I've wasted so much money on this Nikon 5700 and all the accessories. I really thought this would last me a few years until time for an upgrade. I guess I'll have to learn how to sell things on ebay.<br />

 <p>I may be the 1st but my 2100 (UK Model) 3 weeks out of warranty - Lens Error followed by System Error. Happened on last day of family holiday abroad after filling 2 x 64Mb cards, thats around 280 faultless shots. Main worry all the way home was wether the shots were secure to be able to get off when home. Tried all the tricks above can't shift the Lens Error though. Give it the dog to play with and going to buy anything apart from Nikon. Sounds like a massive scandal by them and it needs publising in the camera - trade press.</p>

 <p>I have a 5700 and had the lens problem twice. I managed somehow (by pushing and pulling and turning it on and off) to get it working each time. Now however, the screen is black. Everything else works but black screen and viewfinder. I am currently in Vietnam and took it to a shop here in Hanoi. I was told the CCD is out and it is not worth fixing. The guy said "this was a bad camera" too many design problems. I've had dozens of Nikons in the past but I too will not purchase another Nikon because of these poorly designed cameras and the fact they will not stand behind their products. I'm going to try Canon!!!</p>

 <p>I have a Coolpix 3100 which was Popular Science's best buy in 2003.  Has worked pretty good until now.  The battery door latch has broken and the batteries are not held tight rendering the camera unusable.  Cheap plastic piece of crap. There doesnt seem to be a fix for it.  Not very happy with Nikon right now!</p>

 <p>I have just discovered your site.  I had no idea that this was such a common problem.  I will never buy another Nikon camera, in fact I am so annoyed with Nikon at this moment, that I want any lawyers who have had this problem to add my name to any future class action lawsuits.  Just one month after the warranty ran out on my Nikon Coolpix 2200 camera, the lens is permanently stuck in the open position.  I broke the zoom lens on my Canon digital camera last year, since then I have been extremely careful with the Nikon Coolpix 2200.  The Nikon camera was always carried in a padded camera bag, and I can assure you that it has never been dropped or roughly handled.  I am now trying to find a reliable, small and affordable  digital camera that does not have cheap plastic gears or a retractible zoom lens.  <br />

 <p>I Didn't know that this was the major issue on this camera. I'm very carefull with my photo gear and never dropped it or what so ever. But all of a sudden it dropped dead with the message 'Lens Error' I just wanted to sell my Minolta and make pictures of it with the Coolpix 5700. I didn't know what to do. Once about a year ago i dropt a camera of my friend and the lens was misplaced after de dropped. I just tried to straighten it out and that worked, and the camera is still running. So i thought lets try a little pulling en pushing. Put in and out de battery and after a minute or five it started operating again. I hope this does not happen to much !. So if you want to solve the problem first try a little pulling and pushing, it worked for my. Do not pull hard or push hard just a little !!!!</p>

 <p>After 14 months and 8000 pictures taken with a Nikon Coolpix 5400, the "lens error" come, and the repair is near euros 350 ! so, i change from Nikon to Olympus, the Camedia 7070 is very good for macro photo ; this problem seem to be recurrent on all Coolpix series<br />

<p>I took it to the seller, who returned it to Nikon.</p>

<p>I am waiting for their response; I hope they don't expect any payment, because given the similar problems other people are having, Nikon will be getting nothing out of me!</p>

 <p>I think I've found a temporary fix.<br />
Still, it's not a best repair but you can get the lens out and take pictures. Next time, you get the same problem, do the same again.</p>

<p>1. Turn the power off.<br />
2. Push the lens all the way in with your two thumbs. It will click as it goes in.<br />
3. If the light goes off, then turn it back on - you will notice that lens tries to come out. Right this moment, hit the edge of the lens firmly and it will come out.<br />
4. I had to do this over and over again each and every time I use this damn Coolpix 5400 !!</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

 <p>Hi!</p>

<p>  Own a Nikon 5700 which started to have this lens error problem. This sucks. $1100 down the drain. Anyone know about any repair shops in NY/CT to get an estimate?<br />
</p>

 <p>Aye</p>

<p>I have a 5700 just 14 months old, gears are skipping in the lense unit as it expands and doesn't retract unless gently pushed. Considering the price I paid for this I expected Nikon quality.  I didn't get it ...</p>

<p>Next time I'll but a cheaper one.  In Australia they want $250 to fix it.  Looking at these posts it is not worth it, too likely to die again. </p>

<p>Has anyone performed their own surgery on it ?</p>

 <p>Same error today, but I think I know what caused it. I was taking a picture of a helicopter taking off from dirt, I was close (20m away) and got covered in dirt so I guess the grit jambed the lens mechanism? I've tried the "hitting it" method, didn't work. So I'm going to try blowing it out with compressed air and then hit it...</p>

 <p>My Nikon 5700 suddenly developed a problem.  There's no image on the LCD viewfinder and the camera won't record images.  Otherwise all seems ok.  The preview feature works fine, so I know that the LCD is ok. Has anyone had the same problem (LCD preview works, viewfinder doesn't) or heard of a solution?  </p>

 <p>Hi !</p>

<p>I have a 5700 just 15 months old, trouble in the lense unit, it doesn't expand. I am very surprise that so many people have problems with the Nikon 5700.  </p>

<p>I no more beleive in Nikon quality... </p>

<p>I am waiting since 1 month and a half and know that will cost 300$ to repare it.</p>

<p>My next camera won't be a Nikon, and you???</p>

 <p>Hi, lens error on my 5700 for the second time. First time was while under warranty. What a pile of crap. I'm buying Canon. Oh, I also had a 950 that died of an internal lens issue, and that one didn't retract/expand externally. Now I'll have to go argue with them.</p>

 <p>My Nikkon Coolpix 5900 about 6 months old, went into displaying Lens Error. My nightmare started.<br />
Actuall my camera was ON with suspend timer set to 30min because i was using it as cam through TV Tuner card. Unfortunately the battery exhausted midway, after which my camera started giving lens error and never recovered. I cannot afford to give it to Service  Centre. Can anyone suggest me any solutions.</p>

 <p>I've had my coolpix 5700 for two years now and got the same lens error as the rest of you guys here!!<br />
I have a 5 years extended warranty from Mack Camera so I hope that I will get it fixed for shipping costs only.</p>

<p>Got my cp back from repair in Norway. Thet replaced the hole lens/zoom unit for ca $350, but Mack Camera will pay me back every penny, I love those guys</p>

 <p>Lens Error.. Me too. Dropped the camera from the height of 1 foot onto a padded carpet - lens error! Camera works fine BUT will not zoom all the way into wide angle mode! Takes beautiful photos, but I have handled it VERY carefully since then. Too many people seem to have the same issue, and it seems that it is all related to some cheapness in the lens area - not something you expect when spending NIKON bucks!</p>

The a-hole at Wolf Camera told me he would send it in to the service center and said it may cost me $250.00! and they have a sensor inside the camera that can tell if I have dropped it? Can anyone help me with this? Is this a warranty repair? I am really really angry!!!   </p>

 <p>My 5700 just stopped working as well. I get a SB error and a red flashing light.The internal flash will not respond. I have begun the daunting task of trying to get a response from Nikon and after reading all this I am very upset and frustrated. I will try to get it fixed  as Its still under warranty for the next 4 years and 4 months but I like many others here will never buy Nikon again and I believe that I will look into Cannon, for my next camera purchase.</p>

 <p>With my Coolpix 3200 I just experienced the same Lens Error problem as all of you shortly after the 2 year warranty period.<br />
As I read in the previous posts, that nothing can be done, I started to try to "shake" any stuck parts free - no success.<br />
Then with the help of a tiny screwdriver I wedged this at different places into the gap between the lens body and the surrounding circular camera body part.  My tries to either help the stuck componnent to move the lens forward or to center again a possible offset of the lens body was finally successful.  I think my lens was off center and pressing it tenderly back into alignement happily made it working again.  <br />
What a relief.</p>

 <p>I bought the 8800 7 months ago.  Lens froze two weeks ago.  Nikon tech says send back to repair facility in Melville NY.  followed all their instructions and sent in.  Noted that lens froze and electronics would not come on to retract. Also sent battery as figured though charged, may not be taking the charge. Got letter back that camera had a 'bent pin' and not covered under warranty and that no battery accompanied. Cost to fix $210.</p>

<p>In process now of telling them to just send camera back, may just throw this in the river.  The SLR I was intending to buy will not be bought from Nikon.  Am now back to film using my old Nikon N90s and does it feel good.</p>

 <p>Well, here is another one with a lens error!<br />
It really stinks. I bought my camera in Jan. 2005. I  got a lens error in July  2005. I have a  Coolpix     5400. This is absolutely not acceptable how Nikon can ignore this 'lens error' problem. It should be a  total recall.<br />
Repair expenses would be around 200 dollars. Well I can buy a new one for that.</p>

 <p>Coolpix 3700 came up with Lens error a couple of days ago when using the zoom function.  Took it back to place of purchase (just out of warranty by one month) they advised not worth sending to Nikon to be repaired as would be more than the cost of a replacement.<br />
I too have had the camera repeatedly turn on when in the case, and for past few months lens was not always in fully closed position.<br />
Not another Nikon for me either!!<br />

 <p>I have a coolpix 3700 for almost an year, which I bought in UK. Its a lovely camera and I took some beautiful pictures with it and my friends used to appreciate my photographic skills. And suddenly last week, I got the "lens error" messgae when trying to upload the snaps to my laptop. After going through this useful blog I may have to spank it for a while to make it work again. I hope it works. I can see the slight mis-alignment in the lens.<br />
I will get back with the status later.<br />

 <p>What an insult to an exceptional lens.The plastic gearing lack of ergonomic sense i.e. function buttons on the right and strap clips either side.Make the Nikon 5700 an enthusiasts nightmare.RECALL THIS CAMERA!! not least for all the above mentioned "lens error" messages noted here and most likely by a overwhelming and unacceptable percentage of 5700 owners elswhere,but also try a search for  Nikon 5700 speedlight issues on google.Again you will be overwhelmed by depressing reading.My first 5700 arrived and the speedlight(flash) never even got a chance to fail it was dead in the box! when contacting the vendor he told me this was the second of the batch he had bought to fail.The vendor was  true gent and the camera was replaced immediately even before I had returned my malfunctioning model.The replacement was and is in perfect working order but with  aprehension now rising I am embarking on a search for that suitable replacement.Trying to recoup the money spent on this one is going to delay my new purchase no doubt but I will indeed replace this camera and banish its lurking and inevitable failure.Shame that such a respected imaging company should fail themselves in the face of stiff yet cheap competition.Personally I would encourage Nikon to replace haste with their previous attitude toward precision and quality.had they not panicked then I am sure the Nikon faithfull would have waited patiently for Nikons worthy contender to the semi Pro digital Camera.Instead they have replaced trust and respect with consumer fear.It is a sad sad day.May they learn their lesson and repay the investment of us the consumers for our faith.Recall this Camera Show us you are worth our Yen,dollars,pounds or bart... and I for one would maintain respect and faith.However I feel it is too late and this whisper is soon going to become a roar in the ears of nikons CEO's and a once great name is going to be forever tarnished.Once again modern business practice sounds the nell for a preciscion quality product.</p>

 <p>I have the same problem of a black lcd/viewfinder on my nikon 5700.  LCD is fine, even old pictures stored on my memory card can be viewed on the lcd/viewfinder.  Just a black, sorta fuzzy picture is given when you turn it on.</p>

<p>I took it in to a local authorized nikon repair shop who told me that this is a problem, nikon is recalling the cameras that have this problem and will repair mine free of charge.  Soooo, before dishing out any money to get it repaired, check to see if it can be repaired free of charge.  Contact Nikon, don't give up.  Good luck.</p>

 <p>Ok, got the dreaded "lens error" on my nikon coolpix 5400. The lens was stuck in extended positon and would not budge. In deep frustration I opted on using brute force to solve the issue. With the camera turned off and the battery removed, I grabbed the larger of the two rings composing the lens (the one closer to the camera body) and cranked it harder and harder clockwise until something snapped. Replacing the battery and turning the camera on, the lens retracted! HOWEVER, now I have a grinding noise when zooming out and intermittent (but temporary) lens error messages in certain zoom positions.<br />
I imagine that I basically broke one jammed gear tooth (or several) thus allowing the lens to retract. I wonder how long the camera will function in this state. I'll keep you posted.<br />
This is my third (and last) Coolpix camera (very badly designed battery cover broke on my 950, autofocus malfunctioned on my 4500, now the lens error on the 5400...)<br />
SHAME ON YOU, NIKON!!!</p>

 <p>Happy New Year</p>

<p>Guys I need help!!!! I have a nikon coolpix 5700 and it has been problematic since the last repair i had which was broken gear on the lens.</p>

<p>Now about few months ago a new problem arise after not using for 2 - 3 months. When you adjust the shutter or the aperture, and took a photo, the photo appear to be the same as previous setting instead of the updated adjustment. I have to turn it off and turn it on to refresh into the new adjustment, to get the right photo. </p>

<p>Since the repair as well the noise on the camera just got worst. I have to edit the photos further in photoshop and it is time consuming and nuisance</p>

<p>Could anyone please help me on what going on with this lousy 5700. If it helps i've had it since 2003.<br />
</p>

 <p>Hi,<br />
It happened to me too! “Lens Error”. My Coolpix 5700 was just over 3 years old (have we come to expect everything to be throwaway after a couple of years?) In spite of its flawed focusing abilities in low light, I liked the camera. I enjoyed its portability, and the quality of its lens is superb. <br />
Now, I'm looking at a $1,000 dollar piece of junk. I am raising a family, and $1,000 dollars doesn't come easy. When researching my purchase, it was Nikon’s reputation for quality that convinced me my purchase was a good one. Nikon should be ashamed of releasing a product of such poor quality. Is the venerable Nikon a thing of the past?</p>

<p>Sincerely, Kevin Fellows<br />
</p>

 <p>Coolpix 3100</p>

<p>Got the Lens error message too. I called Nikon (Uk) about repairing it and they said a maximum of £51.06 + VAT. I decided it wasn't worth it so tried Mark's suggestion of hitting it quite hard. It worked. Must have been something out of line jammimng the lens mechanism. Pretty poor though - will not buy a Nikon again. I recommend trying this if you have come to the conclusion that you are not going to pay for it to be repaired.</p>

 <p>This was a great camera until I got the "Lens Error" message.  Paid about $850 for the camera 3 years ago, don't think the thing is worth paying a couple of hundred to fix if it might happen again.</p>

<p>This is the last Nikon I'll ever buy.</p>

 <p>Just experienced the "black LCD/viewfinder" problem with my 2 year-old 5700. All other electronics/functions appear to be working properly.</p>

<p>Thanks to link provided in Post #127 for NikonEurope, where they announced free repairs for 5700's experiencing this, and related problems. I'm in USA, so searched NikonUSA site; found similar announcement here: <a href="http://www.nikondigital.com/main.html.">http://www.nikondigital.com/main.html.</a></p>

<p>Click the 5700-related button at lower-right, under Service Advisories; you'll be directed to download a PDF Product Return Form.</p>

<p>Hope they do repair for free; if not, it goes on the junk heap, and will be replaced by something more dependable, e.g. a Canon. No more Nikons in my future – ever! (spoiled by my 40 year-old film Pentax Spotmatic; still performs like new; felt guilty retiring it).</p>

 <p>I don't get a lens error but my viewfinder went almost black, all the images are like ghosts, the lens moves in and out with no problem but I can not see anything but a ghost image through the viewfinder. I am ready to take my first trip to Europe and this has to happen now, I've always been a Nikon fan from  my first camera the FE up to my new D70, but after reading all this and seeing the attitude of "WE DON'T CARE" from Nikon, instead of buying the new D200, I am switching to Canon. Never again a Nikon, my next camera will be the Canon EOS 5D. <br />
Lets join forces to make Nikon pay for this. We should all get free replacements for this piece of junk.</p>

 <p>Yesterday I took my 14 month old coolpix 5700 out to take pics of my new allotment. The zoom function seemed very sluggish so I took my pics inb wide angle. Today I formatted my card ready to take advantage of the bright weather conditions and was about to head out for the countryside. Switched on the camera to adjust settings and what do I get?  ... the dreaded lens error message. I know it has not been dropped</p>

<p>Now there is a long delay before it switches on or off and the awful grinding sound has stopped as it does not even try to extend the lens any more.<br />
This is a bummer as the camera was a present, and the shop it was bought from no longer sells cameras.<br />
Add me to the list of Nikon's disatisfied customers too.<br />

 <p>Oh dear, add me to the list of Nikon dissapointees.. I purchased a 3700 in New York around a year ago - didn't use it much until last summer then picked it up this winter and 'lens error!' - just tried Geoffs tip and struck the side of the casing closest the lens firmly against the table and it worked! I saw some greast pics of my kids in tree houses - I hesitated before turning it off and trying again but I figured I had to sometime - so I turn it off and then on again and 'Lens Error' - a very short lived victory!!<br />
The lens now comes out when I turn it on but therre's the error message on screen and way more whirring than neccessary when I turn it back off!<br />
I'm goin got try for some satisfaction from Nikon UK...sorry to hear these tales of woe re. a previous favourite - I'll let you know what Nikon UK say.</p>

<p>Hold on... I just tried again and this time held the camera so the lens is pointing atthe ground and i'm looking down onto the screen on horizontal plane and the thing worked - no error message - I repeated it about 7 times and its still working ok- yep, just worked ok again - only thing is I'm scared to hold it upright and try incase it screws up again!</p>

 <p>Hello all here,<br />
Seems like you guys have ended up here after typing the keyword for 'Nikon lens error'in google. Well,the first comment started in 2003 and the last one,just 3 days before mine. well,our family's is Nikon Coolpix 3700..it once was sent for repair when it was still in the warranty's period (when it was returned,my memo card was also gone,)but now that it's out for about one year and a half...only to pay to get it repaired. Damn Nikon!!!!<br />
The cause of the lens error was the same as last time...my sister took the camera away and tried to zoom it up..problem about zooming something like that...<br />
Gonna look for any possible solution on the net and will be back if finding one.</p>

 <p>Hi, <br />
As I didn't have any news about this lens error or any kind of error with nikon, I decided to buy a 5700 coolpix, just the same model as the one I got stolen on madrid when it had only 2 months use.  </p>

<p>Now that my "new" nikon has just passed 12 months the only thing I have is distorted images. Seems the CCD failed. Repare cost here in mexico city: 400 usd plus taxes. I'd better buy another camera, another brand. same price as reparing it.</p>

<p>I now think it's possible the thieves in madrid took my other camera just before it collapsed. I should've known before, and thank them.</p>

<p>Anyway I thought it might be useful to keep it as a didactic aftefact, unless someone has decided to keep their own camera as spare and would be interested on selling me the CCD.<br />
If not, at least i feel better sharing this experience.  Hope this helps someone making a buy decision.<br />
</p>

 <p>My Nikon 3700 went down 2 months after warrenty.  Lens error. Lens exteded and it's been that way since then.  After reading others comments I do not think it's worth fixing as the problem will probably re-occure. Will try an Olympus or a Cannon. </p>

 <p>Every Nikon Coolpix that I have had (I've had a few) has the lens error thing.<br />
Absolutely insane.<br />
I love the cameras when they work, but if it's only going to last just over a year no matter how I treat it, I'm done with Nikon.<br />
It's not worth the hassle.</p>

 <p>Lens error on Nikon 5700 for the second time in six months; paid almost $200 the last time, and unsure as to whether I'll bother again. Much as I love the camera, this is my last Nikon. It's too finicky and ultimately disappointing. This happened while on holiday in Mexico and I spent the last two days regretting all the terrific shots I was missing. Just not good enough. Any recommendations for a better alternative camera?</p>

 <p>Similar problems as listed above. The speedlight on my Coolpix 5700 has stopped working. SB flashes red and will not fire, even with an external Nikon SB50dx flash attached. NOT HAPPY! Instead of purchasing the D200, I'm switching to Canon! </p>

 <p>Spoke to an insider @ Nikon today. You guys having a 5700 or 5400 and the lens error happened either before 12 month or after 15 month are not in line. THOSE CAMERAS ARE DESIGNED AND TESTED TO BRAKE AFTER 13-14 MONTH. You have to understand that with the hard competition in consumer digital cameras Nikon at least has to make some money charging 200.00++ US$ for the repair of a 50 cts part..They NEED this money to put it in their expensive advertising to make you believe they sell a quality product – and have the service you expect from a quality product.<br />
;-) ---.... you know that is fiction...<br />
Stepping up from point and shoot and adding to my semipro Samsung Pro815 ( 28-420mm) I ordered a Nikon Digital SLR D70 with the expensive 400mm tele and a wideangle 12-14mm lens. Until than I covered the wideangle prt with my coolpix 5400 and a Nikon converter which brought the lens to 22.8mm... I wanted to sell my 5400 and checked eBay for prices - just to find 2 offers with " known lens error problem". Now, 2 days later my 5400 got the bug: I was shopping for furniture and took some pics. After I shut off the camera I decided to take an additional picture and turned it on again - but the lens did not come out, just made that noise...no mechanical impact whatsoever on the camera!<br />
Camera is 14 month old...Checking the problem I found this website and phoned Nikon Canada. Reporting the problem and mentioning the postings I heard: "Oh yes, there are many cameras with this problem, not just Nikon" Well trained. Not offering any real help. Trying to send your camera in for that “only 20$s” inspection. Reluctantly admitting that a repair will be over $ 200.00…<br />
NOW, WHAT CAN WE DO?? Class A Action. There are several paper tigers out there asking for it. You should not find your satisfaction in lamenting, BUT IN ACTION.. START IT!  I will join you, but being in Canada I can not do to much…<br />
There is a Better Business Bureau, and Cosumer protection agencies to contact Nikon in behalf of us. Isn’t there anyone here who can take the leadership and organize the complaint? I hope you get this going…<br />
By the way, good thing about my Nikon disappointment: I cancelled my order with Nikon and decided for the Minolta Maxxum 7D. They were always building the best 35mm cameras, now their digital SLR is the only one that has a built in Image Stabilizer – so I got the better camera and saved 3000 bucks! ( I do not mind that they went out of business with cameras – and do not worry, you can expect soon that we see them  with a Sony badge!<br />

 <p>I had the very same "lens error" with my Nikon Coolpix 5900 few hours ago. I hadn't done anything abnormal to my camera. Actually it had been in my schoolbag few days waiting for a photo opportunity.</p>

<p>Then a photo situation suddenly came up. I took my beloved cam, turned it on and LENS ERROR! I panicked, as it was already out of warranty. I tried to turn it on and off again, but it didn't help. When I came home I looked at camera's user manual. It didn't help, so I looked to ultimate source of truth, Internet.</p>

<p>I did as HJK told in his comment. I pushed the lens with my thumb for a while. Then I became frustrated and hit the camera to my desk (just a bit, not with force). Repeating the hitting operation did the trick. So thank you guys for your advices :)</p>

 <p>Yep... me too. My camera is a couple years old and has a lot of miles (literally) but I just landed on a flight from NY to Las Vegas and the camera must have turned on in my carry on. The battery was almost dead and lens was sticking out a few millimeter. It must have tried to open and hit the bottom of the bag... No, it will not turn on... only lens error.</p>

<p>I will try leaving the battery out over night and see if anything happens. I will try to "gently knock it" on the table... this stinks. I understand the "disposable" universe we live in, but I too have a lot of accessories (investment) in this camera and I NEED IT on this trip.. ohwell... so it goes.. so it goes...<br />
I'll probably line up for the expensive repair because we still like taking photos with this camera and we have so much "stuff" (lens, adapters, etc) for it....</p>

I called the customer service about the strong green tint on the view finder and the LCD but they never pointed me to the service advisory that they have on the website. So its okay if people don't know aout it and pay ?!!!<br />

 <p>Another disgruntled Nikon owner.  Several weeks past the service warranty on my wife's camera; you guessed it: LENS ERROR.  The gears are making a horrible noise.  Called a local camera dealer and he too said this was a common problem with Nikon camera's.  Guess Nikon does not rely on repeat business.  WOW!!!  Great business model!    </p>

 <p>Ok for those who've been getting those stuck lens this is the problem. One of the gears is damaged. Most likely the smallest one has its teeth broken which does cause a huge problem. I don't have my warranty anymore but I've already been planning on getting a new camera after my 3700 had its lens error a few months ago. I've had if for about 2 years now. Who would've guessed that such a small thing made out of PLASTIC could cause such a huge problem.</p>

 <p>I had two years service on the 3700; carried it every day. Yesterday the "lens error message" appeared and it looks like another dead camera.</p>

<p>Too bad, I liked the size and pictures it took, but it failed when I needed  a picture. The market is full of small cameras, any ideas about a reliable small camera using sd cards and AA batteries?</p>

 <p>Well here we are less than a year goes by and now the repaired (for free - 2yrs old) (lens error) coolpix 5700 suddenly goes blank. Turns on but no pics on either screen. Sent it back to nikon UK they are going to fix it as per the recall notice FOC. So why when they had the camera last time did they not replace the 'sometimes' faulty part? I can't fault the picture quality but what use is a camera as badly designed and unreliable as this?<br />
Still saving for an EOS and nearly there...can't wait. <br />
I WILL NEVER BY ANOTHER NIKON.</p>

 <p>I think I've found a temporary fix.<br />
Still, it's not a best repair but you can get the lens out and take pictures. Next time, you get the same problem, do the same again.</p>

<p>1. Turn the power off.<br />
2. Push the lens all the way in with your two thumbs. It will click as it goes in.<br />
3. If the light goes off, then turn it back on - you will notice that lens tries to come out. Right this moment, hit the edge of the lens firmly and it will come out.<br />
4. I had to do this over and over again each and every time I use this damn Coolpix 5400 !!</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

 <p>I've owned Nikon Coolpix 5400 for 2 years and everything was fine till today: I was taking pictures of my new car when this bloody problem appeared: "Lens error"!! The lens zooms out a bit but if you try to use zoom option it stops working with the lens error sign. I tried all solutions posted here except for removind a battery for a half of a day. Damn, tonight I was supposed to take pictures of my friend's little girl dancing on the stage!!! I am not going to repair the camera: it was bought in Europe and now I am living in the States. Sad to say, but it's time to buy a new one. </p>

 <p>After an aeroplane flight our Nikon 3700 came up with a red 'lens errror.' The lens would not open. After reading these comments and as it was out of warrenty I decided to drop it. I held the cord with the camera in its case about a metre from our wooden floors and smack. I turned it on and WOW it was fixed. Amazing! Thanks for the tip. :)</p>

 <p>I have two Nikon Coolpixs--the 5700 and the 3100.  I got the lens error message a few months ago on the 5700 and hadn't pursued fixing yet--thinking it would be a small glitch that would be easy to fix.  After a lot of internet research last night, no way I'll spend any extra money on it. </p>

<p>Actually, I hated the camera anyway.  I got beautiful pictures as long as the subject was stationery and in bright light.  Inside, the pictures were either too dark, or it took so long for 5700 to focus that I missed my shots.  At SeaWorld, nearly all of my Shamu pictures were a second too late, and most only had water splashing or the tip of Shamu's tail.  I ended up using the 3100 most of the time anyway because I was so frustrated with the 5700.  </p>

<p>My 13 yr old nephew is into Taekwondo tournaments big time, forget taking any good pictures in a poorly lit gymnasium.  I am so sick of photos that are too dark and impossible to fix with photo editing software.  </p>

<p>I going to scrap the 5700, buy a Canon Digital Rebel XT, and use the 3100 for as long as it lasts as a small backup when I don't feel like dragging the Canon.  $1000 down the drain--which bothers me greatly as I don't have this kind of money to throw out the window. Very disappointed in "quality" of Nikon--I had a film Minolta Maxxum that I adored, it finally broke after 12 years.  I miss it.  </p>

<p>Thanks for letting me vent!</p>

 <p>Had the same problem as u all with my Nikon coolpix 3700, "lens error", the lens will not open. Had my camera for two years. Searched the web after lens error and found this blog. I took the advice and dropped the camera on the floor and now my lens is moving again. But I don't know for how long. Now the cover of the lens, after turning the camera off, will not shut down and cover the lens. After reading this blog I will buy Canon next time.</p>

 <p>My Coolpix 3200 displayed a "Lens error" message, and would not extend. After searching through archived messages at jancology.com/blog/ I stumbled upon Kathy's message posted August 31, 2004. I too found success by wiggling the lens components; believe this reseated the lens properly. Works like a charm now. Thanks Kathy!</p>

 <p>I have a Coolpix 3200, and have been very happy with the pictures it takes.  However, it too got a lens error when still under warranty.  They fixed it.  Now, I have gotten another lens error (out of warranty), and the camera appears to now be useless.  I can see by this blog that I am not alone.  It may be pointless, but I think I will send Nikon a nasty letter.  I will be sure to let them know I will be looking at their competition for a replacement.</p>

 <p>My sister's coolpix 4200 just got that lens error.  I googled for the lens error and ran into this site.   She would turn the camera on and get the lens error.  The lens would pop out then retract immediately so I had her turn it back on but hold the lens out and pull hard.  Well that did it, the lens pops out and retracts when you shut the camera off and the "lens error" is gone.  Give it a try before you dump it in the trash.  Good luck getting yours back up and working.</p>

 <p>I was damn happy and proud to have Nikon 5700. Every time i took snap, i praised this camera and company. I thought i invested in something which is quality. Now this camera does show me any picture. LCD and Pictureview are black.</p>

<p>I purchased this in London and now i am in India. I can not tell you how do i feel...it is bad and very sad to read all these information on this site about world famous camera company.</p>

<p>Nikon needs to learn to appreciate people trust and money.</p>

<p>Can somebody help me here to get it repaired and/or replaced? Warranty period is over and no chance to be in London soon.</p>

 <p>We have the Coolpix 8800.  We had the camera at my sister-in-law's wedding this past weekend.  Wife dropped it from about 3 feet.  As you can guess Lens Error.  Searched the internet found this website.  read a lot of the '04 posts then skipped to the bottom. Found the post from Kathy August 31, 2004.  Started fiddling with the lens itself.  Low and behold when i pressed straight down on the lens (so if the camera is sitting on the table with the lens pointing up at you) it clicked like it reseated itself and now the lens error is gone.  Camera worky worky wifey happy happy :).  I'm happy as well not having to spend 300 bux for some  idgit to push the lens back in.  Luckily for us it wasn't the extension/retration lens gears that were messed up.  Thanks for sparking my intellect!</p>

 <p>Have just had the same problem. and 10 weeks out of warranty.  Service agent says tough and I say I'm talking to Nikon direct perfore I go to our fair trading commision.</p>

<p>By the look of it the camera's should be recalled.  No way I'm paying for it to just break again.  We've got Cannons and Pentax's at work and they cop a beating with no probs.  I buy a Nikon for home use thinking I'm getting something good and it can stand the gental use of home.</p>

 <p>Just reporting in to say that since my last Lens Error back in November 2004 I have treated the camera kindly at all times, (feeding it only the finest of fuly chaged batteries) and have not been troubled since.</p>

<p>The various comments from people about applying gentle pressure on the lens make sense, but I wonder what the chances of getting the gears "out of phase" might be.</p>

<p>We relegiously kept it in "Play" mode to avoid this...</p>

 <p>Own a coolpix 5000.</p>

<p>Lens has simply stuck in the extended position.</p>

<p>Error Message: 'Warning Remove Lens Cap'</p>

<p>Lens cap is not on. Lens will not move in or out, even if i remove the battery, etc.  </p>

<p>Can access the setup menu and even bypass the shooting mode to eventually be able to get an image in the LCD display.  But no luck snapping a picture.  Have updated Firmware to ver.1.6 and 1.8.  No change.</p>

<p>No grinding or any such mechanical failure noises.  Simply Stuck.</p>

<p>I leave for Venice in two days for an exhibition, not happy.</p>

Anyone hav any suggestions other than hitting it?</p>

 <p>Coolpix 5700 - "Lens Error"</p>

<p>Love the camera, many great pictures over three years.  Religiously clicked play mode when camera turned off to ensure I would not obstruct the lens from opening as I was aware of this design fault.</p>

<p>Lens cap string got caught in flip screen, when I turned the 5700 on  :(   click, click, click - oh crap!  Lens error.</p>

<p>It's done, will be $265 CDN to repair.</p>

<p>This is also ridiculous - I'd bet that almost every 5700 has been or will be damaged in this manner.  And I was sooooo careful...</p>

<p>Now I need decide if I want to fix it or go with the new panasonic water and shock proof camera I've been hearing about...</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Rd  :)</p>

 <p>I have had my 5700 for about 3 years. I, also, bought this camera because of wonderful reviews and Nikon's reputation. It has worked beautifully up until now. NOW when I take a picture it records the image as “nearly white with darker horizontal lines.” When looking through the viewfinder everything looks normal. Does anyone know what going on?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
Alan</p>

Check the Nikon web site (support) sounds like a known issue that they will fix for free no matter how old your camera is. Its the CCD chip, it simply fails. Nikon replaced it in my 5700.<br />

 <p>Well... I just wanted to add my name to the list of people experiencing the "lens error" message. Happened to me about 8 months into owning my Coolpix 7600. It was my first camera - which I bought because I was told Nikon was the best... after spending $500 on the camera, which is a lot for me as I was going through college at the time, so money wasn't readily available. Makes me so happy I saved up the money to buy this one.</p>

<p>Anyway, the famous error happened to me last night - well, actually to my sister who was using it at the time. Now the lens is stuck half extended, and won't move either way. </p>

<p>She'd told me she'd pay for it to be fixed, and I told her - no worries, if I was the one using it at the time, it would have happened to me. After reading this page, I knew it was just a matter of time.</p>

<p>So, I stumbled upon this site and learn that this is a pretty common problem, and that it comes with some really big price tags. Great, I hope I'm still under warrenty. </p>

<p>So I go digging around for my bill and the warrenty the camera came with - turns out it's a two year warrenty. Nice. They better honour it. I'm afraid they won't, based on what I've read here, but if that's the case, I'm going to get them to send it back without fixing it, and I'll just buy another camera.</p>

<p>I'm sick of this. You buy something cause it's "the best" and find out the whole line is crap. I don't think I'll be buying from Nikon any longer. So much for being so careful with my newest investment.</p>

<p>Thanks for letting me know I'm not alone,<br />
Amanda</p>

 <p>Had "lens error" on coolpix 3700 when turning on - lens remaining fully retracted, searched the web and found this site.</p>

<p>Turned camera off and tapped the lens area firmly on the heel of my hand, turned it back on again and the lens extended, camera fully operational - but for how long!</p>

 <p>Oh my god SO ANNOYED! My parents just got me a Nikon L1 as a 21st birthday present. I got it Saturday afternoon. It is now Monday evening, and all of a sudden this stupid lens error thing has come up. The worst of it is that the lens is fine - it's not jammed or anything. Camera was sitting happily on my bed inbetween working and not working. I turn it on, lens comes out all happy and normal, then stupid screen says lens error and it retracts the lens again.</p>

 <p>As with all my "toys" when they take a crap, I google searched for any info.  My 5700 has been making that awful clicking sound when retracting/extending the lens and the "lens error" message is displayed through the view screen.  After reading the comments above for the last 15 minutes I've decided to throw my POS foolpix against a brick wall and enjoy the sight of it being in little pieces.  I'm heading to Costco for a Canon soon after doing so.</p>

 <p>I had an out of warranty coolpix 5400 with stuck lens assembly making grinding noises. Sometimes the lens would come out if the camera was held at 90 degrees (portrait orientation). The gear linking the lens assembly to the optical view finder was stripped (again). I don't know if this is the same gear that's failing other people.<br />
My main lens gears are still good. I decided to remove the broken gear and unlink the optical view finder.<br />
Looking at the front of the camera, the stripped gear was at the 2'oclock position relative to the big lens, under a metal L-bracket. It's possible to only remove the front half of the camera body. careful- there's a flexi-cable under the shutter button going over the 'top' to the back of the camera.<br />
I carefully dissasembled using a #00 philips screw driver -- use an ice cube tray to keep the screws sorted. And watch the capacitor powering the flash. discharge with a 2kOhm 5W resistor- I used an incandescent bulb and a voltmeter to discharge it from over 200Volts over several minutes. Make extensive notes/photos of were screws go/how ribbon cables are routed. Don't forget to check under i/o covers for screws, or the 2 screws under the CF slot cover.</p>

 <p>I got the same “Lens Error” on my CoolPix 5700” after less than 3 years of normal use.<br />
As a good Electronics Engineer I turned it into  pieces.<br />
I have found that one of the plastic gears box part is broken.<br />
Since I handle my FoolPix with a lot of care, my conclusion is that this happens due to weakness of the gearbox, which was poorly designed.<br />
This gear supports the zoom system and should have made of metal and not a cheap plastic.<br />
Also a simple current limit circuitry would protect the gear when the lens is stuck.<br />
Unfortunately Nikon doesn’t sell this 1-cent plastic piece, so I have to buy the lens assembly for $125 (http://gallery.bcentral.com/GID2025592P2786253-Replacement-Parts/Nikon/Digital-Camera-Parts-By-Model/Nikon-Coolpix-5700/Nikon-Coolpix-5700-Lens-Unit.aspx)<br />
I’m going to complain to Nikon USA and CC this link to them and hundreds of my friends.<br />
Next time don’t buy Nikon (I have noticed that Cannon is the best)<br />

 <p>Hello all,</p>

<p>Yes, same lens error situation<br />
.<br />
Two things on this. First a question to Alon (item 225). Do you happen to have a description on how to disassemble the coolpix 5700? Preferably with schemes, fotos or the like. Could you please send it to jan.roelf@hetnet.nl? I checked the URL and I saw a lens drive gear for $ 5.95. Is this the thing that allways brakes down?</p>

<p>Second (to everyone here): would it be possible to remove the gear and zoom in and out twisting the outer barrel of the lens and still have a working camera. I would love that since I'm not particular keen on those electronic controlled zoom buttons. I guess maybe some wires have to be connected and software adapted, because probably the software will only give ready after a signal is received that the lens is out.<br />
Interesting thougt isn't it. It would sure solve a lot of problems.<br />

 <p>I had a nikon 5400 coolpix for just about a year, then the CCD is dead, blind completely. I hope there would be enough voices that nikon should take actions for its own good. Apparently there are inherent defects within the camera that should be dealt with like "recalls" ...</p>

 <p>I have it also, on my 5400... Camera was never dropped, and the lens wasn't blocked when it happened. I'm thinking of buying an SLR in the near future, but seeing all these comments I'm losing faith in Nikon. My Nikkormat is over 35 years old and still works perfectly. Are Nikon's digital SLRs as unreliable? </p>

 <p>I had a lens error with my Coolpix 5700 last year; and I paid $250 to repair it at the service center in Southern California. After a year and about 100 photos later, it developed another problem. Both LCD and viewfinder were green and blurry. I took my 5700 outdoor at bright daylight; and rest it to system defaults in the setup menu. I could not resolve the problem. I can still shoot pictures; however, the pictures come out blurry. <br />
I plan not to repair it anymore because I don’t know what it can happen next. Does anyone experience a similar problem as mine?<br />

 <p>I got my Nikon coolpix 3200 when it came out i have watched it out perform and take better looking pictures then expensive 7 megapixel cameras of today. My first lens error came about a month ago i just hit the camera with my palm a little and it worked fine. I got about 40 more pictures with it then the lens error started again. I thought about reinstalling the firmware but i see know that it is an unfixable problem. I am devistated I loved that camera.</p>

 <p>Well, I just want to come out as the one voice that says I have had NO problems with the cheap gear lens grinding stripping problem.  However, my viewfinder and screen went black a few days ago, pictures come out all black (no, the lens cap is NOT on). I guess I'm SOL too......such beautiful pictures while it worked, great reviews too...</p>

 <p>My 5700 also came up with the "Lens Error".  I tried all the obligatory battery removal, banging around, etc with no luck. Went on Ebay and found a guy in Atlanta, Ga. that fixes these problems.  Cost is $125+$12 shipping. This is the complete price.  No estimate charge or any other hidden charges. He fixed my 5700 up the day after he received it and had it on it's way back to me the following day by Priority Mail. Also guarantees his work for 90 days.  Goes by the Seller Name "cameralove" on Ebay.  Reccommended!!</p>

 <p>Did any of you CALL Nikon? I got the same error on my DS70--read this list and about crapped my pants. I called the tech (who answered in less than 1 min-- a record in my book  -- and said to do this:<br />
Go to the set up menu.<br />
Go to reset all<br />
Viola! Works like it always did <br />
(Note: I didn't hear any unusual grinding when I got the error).</p>

<p>The link above is for Chuck. I believe you may be able to send in your camera based on this service advisory from Nikon (link above). I found it while searching for answers regarding my "Lens Error" problem with my Coolpix 5700. As I can see from all of these posts. Nikon isn't fixing these errors. Of course my camera is almost 5 years old and I experience this problem twice before early on but it hasn't happened since until yesterday. I hope you can get your camera fixed Chuck!</p>

<p>P.S. If anyone does figure out anything with the Lens Error, please post!</p>

 <p>Wow. I did a search on lens error; guess I'm not the only one. I just bought the Nikon L3 for my husband as a wedding gift a couple months ago and a couple days ago it slipped out of his hands and lightly hit the ground and well, you all know the rest of the story. 'Lens Error'  The thing won't retract. I'm praying the store will take it back or exchange it.  I used to work in a camera store and as long as all the packaging is there I believe they are able to just mark it as defective and send it back to the manufacturer.  I was just hoping they would give me a new one, but after reading most of these posts, I think I'm going to see if I can get store credit and get another brand instead.  I own a fugifinepix and I love the thing.  It's taken a beating over the four or five years I've had it and the thing still works great.</p>

 <p>I own a coolpix 4300. Guess what? Yes the infamous system error. I tried everything to fix it and it was broken for days. I was just about to give up when I figured I would give it one more try. I got really frustrated and with the camera on and displaying the error I pushed in on the lens as it was stuck about half way out. After giving it a few nice pushes it retracted, I powered off the camera and turned it back on and yay! Its working again, no more sytem error. I hope I do not get this problem again, seems many people are having this issue. I cannot believe for the price you pay for things and the parts you pay for are junk. Next camera I buy is for sure going to be a Cannon, I have heard nothing but good things about them, and cannot say the same thing for Nikon. I know banging and pushing on the lens is normally not a good idea, but I figured when all else fails why not try anything. Really cannot believe force actually worked in this case. But none the less im still not a satisfied customer :( </p>

 <p>Same infamous "LENS ERROR" problem on my 5400. (after one year).  Very dissapointed w/ Nikon quality.  Definitely, Nikon SHOULD admit and SHOULD RECALL every single camera. Lens Gear box is cheap plastic that wears out and ends up getting stuck.  The lens will unlock but later photos turn out blury and out of focus.  I already bought a Cannon. My advise, stay away from Nikon. Do not even try to fix junk.  Get quality. </p>

 <p>I may be one of the lucky ones! Compared to many of the problems I have read about. I have the Coolpix 5700 purchased new 2 1/2 years ago for $899.  Since the product was so new, there were no reviews available online to read.  Im a serious advanced landscape photographer and I am  extremely displeased with the performance of this camera.  Was my first crack at digital. At least I know now that it wasnt me afterall!  Results at best are hit and miss. Sometimes the results are nearly flawless, other times no matter what you do in aperture priority, shutter priority, adjust stops, you cannot get satisfactory results. So many shots along the maine coast have been rendered almost white.  I have spent literally hours with the manual, camera on tripod experimenting with this demonic machine!  About the only problem I have yet to encounter is the actual "mechanical breakdown" or lens error/gear drive malfunction.   I can only hope there is a class action suit against Nikon due to this products performance.  In no way, shape or form does it perform up to its lofty status Nikon had us to believe.   I will say this, recently purchased the Sony Alpha 100 D-SLR body to match up to my collection of Maxxum lenses I own (my transparency days) and could not be happier. WOW, no stacked and confusing menus. No mistakenly pressed buttons, beautiful easy to read dials up top. MINOLTA, now that was a camera!  many thanks to SONY for resurrecting the Minolta camerabody.  </p>

 <p>Well, I guess I am the 244th!  We have had our Nikon Coolpix for about 3 or 4 years and today was our "lens error" day. I googled the term hoping for some explanation, other than "its time to buy a new one", but without any quick fixes, it makes absolutely no sense but to invest in a new camera. OBVIOUSLY NOT ANOTHER NIKON!!!  Well be sure to pass on the great quality of work NIKON!</p>

 <p>I also received a Nikon Coolpix for Christmas this past year. Which means I've had it for barely 2 months and already the flash has stopped working and I got the Lens error message. I smacked it around a bit..I don't think I had a warranty and I'm definitely not going to pay to fix it. So what can it hurt right? It's working now..for the mostpart. Anyone know how to fix the flash though?? My email address is Morbidgoddess06@aol.com. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

 <p>Another Lens Error tale here. Coolpix L2 6Megas. Bought this in Madrid for 300euros 5 months ago. Dropped it from 50cms height and voila lens error. Have tried pushing the lens in but ain't working. Off to buy a Canon today! (my previous camera was a Canon that got stolen). The Nikon worked well, I love the big screen...until today.</p>

 <p><b>Nikon Coolpix 5700 Lens Error on my son's <strong>2nd Birthday!</strong></b></p>

<p>Yes, this afternoon is my only son's 2nd birthday and I went to make sure all batteries were charged this morning and when I turned on the camera I got the Lens Error. I have the lens adapter that I always keep on to protect the lens cylinder and the lens itself.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've gotten some really good pictures with it but in poor lighting it does not do as well as my friend's Sony. In fact, he has two Sony's and they both seem to get better pictures more consistently (better colors outdoor, much better shots indoor and at night simply using the default automatic settings). The Sony menu is also much more intuitive. </p>

<p>Was hoping My Nikon would last another 2 years. This was my first and last Nikon. I'll be getting either a Sony or a Canon next time - maybe an SLR version.  </p>

 <p><b>There is hope......</b></p>

<p>I checked the internet including this forum and saw that most Lens Error repairs are around $200 - $300. I then checked eBay and the camera sells for about that much. So, fixing it is arguably not worthwhile. I removed the battery and memory card for 10 minutes and tried again. No luck. As such, I had nothing to lose. I gently pushed the lens cylinder back in and heard it pop. So, did it pop into place??? or get totally mangled? </p>

<p>One way to find out.....I powered it on and it is working. Pictures look good.</p>

<p>There is hope! But try this at your own risk. Off to the birthday party!</p>

 <p>While taking the trip of my lifetime in Israel this past summer, got the "Lens Error" message and my 5700 would no longer work.  Missed a lot of pictures.  This is my 4th coolpix and LAST Nikon product.  Sounds like Cannon is the way to go.<br />
BTW, found a guy on ebay who fixes the "Lens Error" problem for $125.  Paid the $125 for "the fix".  Received the camera back and that problem was fixed (at least for the time being).  2 days later the images are grossly distorted with greenish/purple colors.  Find out the new problem is with the CCD.  Nikon is fixing this problem at no charge, but wondering why they won't also fix the "Lens Error" problem revolving around what seems to be the plastic gear problem.  Oh well, unless Nikon makes restitution for those of us who've already paid to have fixed what seems to be their faullty design, I'll not purchase a 5th Nikon.  I'm not holding my breath...so I guess it's Adios, Nikon!</p>

 <p>Hi Guys,</p>

<p>I have a Nikon Coolpix 5400.  I leant it to a friend when he went on a holiday.  He accidently turned on the camera while the lens cap was still on.  He took the lens cap off while the camera was still on.  </p>

<p>When it was returned to me, shortly after using it the LCD screen flashed "Lens Error" and the lens got stuck half way.  A few months later I just read on a similar forum to this that some people have had success, pushing the lens back into the camera while it is off manually.</p>

<p>I thought I had nothing to lose, and bingo it works again now!  I don't know how long it will work for, trouble free, but I thought some people would like to know this info.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

 <p>My Nikon CoolPix 5200 had a "LENS ERROR!" yesterday, the lens stuck inside the camera, can’t do anything about it. Unfortunately, mine is about two years old, I guess it’s way out of the warranty now. What a shame!</p>

 <p>bmmm bmmm bmmmmmm (that is funeral taps for my CP 5400) I'll admit, I cried as if my doggie had been hit by a car when I got the "Lens Error" message. On picture 4406, the auto focus stopped working all together. I'd never had any problems with it and then one day it wouldn't focus. I turned the camera off, counted to 10, and then turned it back on. (my first response to anything electronic that doesn't cooperate) </p>

<p>The lens won't even come out, it just makes a motor noise and then says "lens error." I don't hate Nikon yet, this camera took the best macro shots of any digital camera I've handled. I am shocked at the amount of money that I've seen quoted for repairs. Not sure if it is worth it to get it fixed or just spend the same amount on another 5400. I have yet to find a digital camera that can focus to 1 cm and has the flip screen so I can frame my shot without being on my belly (I do nature macros).... *sigh* I really didn't want to join this club, but if someone does get the class action lawsuit going, I'm all over it!</p>

 <p>Here is a suggestion on how to prevent you camera from geting "LENS ERROR!" </p>

<p>Using single AF model, in this case, the camera only focus when you press the shutter release button. </p>

<p>Another method is put your camera in a safe box, never use it and you will never get "LENS ERROR!" </p>

<p>remember Never buy Nikon again.</p>

 <p>I got the 'lens error' on my CP 5900 midway through a weeklong vacation - lens won't open or extend. So, missed out on the photo ops. Just found this site when I googled the 'lens error'. I can't beleive this has been going on since the first post dated Nov '03. I got this camera June '05 - I should have googled before I got the camera.</p>

<p>And I can't believe there is no official response from Nikon. So, the only thing we could do right now is to spread the word and warn other digicam buyers of this Nikon problem. </p>

<p>I got an online Nikon repair quote from precisioncamera for $181. Of course, you can get a good new Canon for that price. </p>

 <p>Hi i have a Nikon 3200 coolpix. I got this lens error around 6 months ago. Sent it to the dealer JJ Mehta who charged me 3000 rupees (around US$ 80) to repair. Couple of weeks ago the lens error has cropped again. Phoned the Nikon service center InterFota. The guy pretended as if he was hearing the problem the first time ever. Quite frustrating. Anyone has any suggestions. I dont want to buy a Nikon again....ever......<br />

 <p>CoolPix 3200<br />
Switched on the camera today morning and the lens started to extend out. stopped in the middle and got the lens error. Removed the battery out and pushed the lens back manually all the way back. then added the battery and started working. </p>

<p>Give it a try. :-)<br />

 <p>I have missed so many opportunities for great photos because of the "lens error" problem on my 5700 which I paid $1200 for. I am retired on a small income and now I have to either spend more $$$ to get the 5700 fixed or purchase a new camera. I have read good reviews about the D-80 SLR but am not sure I should take a chance on another Nikon, but I think getting away from the motor driven lenses would be a good move. The price of the D-80 would really hurt my piggy bank bug is it worth spending $300 to fix the 5700 and then have it break again? Maybe I should just go back to film.</p>

 <p>Hi!<br />
Just met the "lens error" message today on my 3 year old Nikon coolpix 5700 camera! I have read about giving the camera a hard knock. After a while I got the courage. IT WORKED! The lense retracted and the camera started again! <br />
So no more stupid stories about non-violence. Hit your coolpix!!<br />

I called Nikon, there is a service advisory for coolpix series. they ask me to print the form and send it back to Nikon, they will fix it free.</p>

<p>Now I believe all you  guys need call Nikno, complain about this, they should do something about this. </p>

<p>Two days later, the screen is totally black. I have to brought films from COSTCO and use my old Minolta XE7 for my daughter's birthday.</p>

<p>I just love my XE7, it is more than 20 years, but is is still solid and work like a tank.</p>

 <p>I dropped my Nikon L6 from the drivers seat of my SUV to the carpeted floor, and got the lens error message. After hours of tinkering, I visited this message board and was about to give up on it. A few minutes ago I rapped it sharply, bottom down on my desk. The viewfinder lit up and it works perfectly now. Now I wonder how long it will work!</p>

 <p>I've had the 'SB' error for over a year, and having seen these posts warning me that Nikon will bleed me dry on this, hadn't attempted to fix it.  After taking it out recently to see how it's doing, I see a completely black screen & viewfinder, and if I still try to click, see the SB error.  I agree, last time I'll buy a Nikon.  They should be called Ni-cons.  Ni being for Nickel (& Diming B**tards)</p>

Reading these many posts tells me it is an ongoing problem.  Does anyone know how to initiate a recall on the product? It obviously is not mishandling by we users.<br />

 <p>Owned my 5700 since Dec 2004.  Lens Error happened about 18 months in (camera turned on with lens cap on in the bag).  With luck, I pushed it in when powering on, and it worked again.  However, the gears continued to grind.  This was OK until this past April when I got another lens error (same issue - lens opened with cap on - should have learned my lesson).  Now the cam is officially a POS.  I can force the lens in and out by hand, but the gears just spin around inside.  Had the CCD issue fixed last year under the recall, but I am assuming I am SOL with this one.  I will never buy Nikon again.  I will take my US$700 and put it towards a Canon Digital Rebel instead. </p>

I even repaired my broken ccd this year (free of charge), but bad thing happened afterwards. I pushed my memory card in the hole too hard and bent one pin. Even when i leveled it up, the camera won' take pictures. Has anyone had any solution ?<br />

 <p>Same lens problem with the 5700. Almost caused me to have a nervous breakdown as I was on a once in a lifetime trip to Europe that I had saved up for years to take. Now retired I really cannot afford this kind of problem not to mention all the missed opportunities while on that European trip. Maybe that is why they call those Kodak moments and not Nikon moments. I suppose if I do manage to get it repaired it would be smart to remove the battery when not using the camera so that the lens cannot accidentally come out and break the gears, if that is what causes the problem.</p>

 <p>A "lens error" is not the exclusive problem of Nikon.  Every other digital camera brand with telescoping lens barrels are subject to this problem.  For example, Google "E18 error" to read of Canon owners lamenting never buying another Canon again.  As many have discovered, there are several non-invasive techniques that may work in correcting this problem.  Here's a compilation of several of these techniques (if the link doesn't work, cut and paste the URL into your browser):<br />

 <p>Well i know what u guys are talking about, because today i dropped my nikon and when i turned it on, it said "lens error", so guess what!!! I found out how to fix it at home. Just check out your lens and make sure the sliding part of it isnt slightly crooked or out or place and if it is, simpli push it back in or try to gently pull it out. If you cant grab it with your fingers then just go to micheals and get one of the beading tools. with this tool you will be able to really grab on to that specific part and do what ever need be! dudes and dudettes I tottali understand what u mean cuz i was pissed wen i saw the " lens error" message on my new 2 month cam! </p>

 <p>Possible cause for lens error. My 5400 starting giving lens error only when lens zoomed out to max extent. The left side mounting lug for neck strap is loose. When I zoom lens out, I can feel the lug move as lens mechanism hits it. I think the mounting screw for the left side neckstrap lug has backed out and hits lens mechanism. If I can disassemble camera, tighten lug, reassemble camera and have it work, I'll be in business! Anyone have experience with successful disassembly and reassembly of a Nikon 5400? KNow of any web sites with pictures of the process?</p>

    Add one more mad consumer to the class action against Nikon.  You have read it all before.   I have two Nikon 7600 cameras.  Loved them until this month.  Both 1 month out of warranty.  Both with stuck lenses!!!!  Wish I had found this site before purchase.  I am going to contact Nikon...then write reviews on every Nikon site I can find!</p>

 <p>My daughter dropped her Coolpix S10 on marble floor & of course got the "lens error" message on screen. I had read someone's suggestion to hold in the preview button (one with camera icon above it) while turning power button on. This worked perfectly. Camera operates great as long as she always turns it on in this manner.</p>

 <p>Well, I wanted to add my name to the 'Lense Error' list.  I was really annoyed to see manny people out there are having the same problem.  Especially since I just purchased several D models for my lab.  </p>

<p>I have a suggestion, it's time we let Nikon know the power of the internet.  Send out an email to everyone you know and tell them not to purchase Nikon because of their design flaws and attach this blog so they can judge for themselves.  Only by hitting them in the pocket will our pleas for a recall be heard. </p>

<p>Peace</p>

<p>Hi!<br />
Just met the "lens error" message today on my 3 year old Nikon coolpix 5700 camera! I have read about giving the camera a hard knock. After a while I got the courage. IT WORKED! The lense retracted and the camera started again!<br />
So no more stupid stories about non-violence. Hit your coolpix!!<br />

 <p>I would really like to thank Antonio Soares for the link to repairs for the lens error problem</p>

<p><a href="http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2007/12/fixing-lens-error-on-digital-camera.html">http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2007/12/fixing-lens-error-on-digital-camera.html</a></p>

<p>I bought a Nikon P6000 two weeks ago for digiscoping and was using it for the second time today and got this lens error message.</p>

<p>There are several tips on the link above to help and all I had to do was take the battery out and then the memory card, then put the battery back in and turn on the camera again, then put back in the memory card and thank goodness the camera is working properly again.  Hope this might help someone out there and that you all get your cameras working again soon.</p>
